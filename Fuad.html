      I decided it's high time for me to refresh my website. True, I have been working on my base of the last 3 years on and off, which did prove fruitful in the end as I managed to lead entirely from scratch an entire, private base, fully backed up and interconnected with a wide variety of services. Fuad hub if you may call it. But in the end this is not a proper portfolio piece that I could showcase to potential employers, so if I'm looking forward to getting myself employed, I needed to show something just better, clearer, sharply decisive and precisely creative (?). That defines what my current design guidelines and what I know and can do, encapsuled in one.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so based on my previous experience with some libraries and some that I just learned quite recently, I decided to utilize what I have managed to achieve on my private playground and create a clean, innovative and fun to interact with carte blanche. I managed to achieve in 90% what I intended, as the portfolio pieces were supposed to redirect to specific overviews of my work, such as graphic design, ux, hci... etc. But I guess what I managed to create is even better now as it showcases concrete examples of my work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided to make sure that anyone could still navigate through this website, so I introduced a number of fluid-like features. Even if you don't do anything, it will proceed to next slides. Progressive features include hovering and I made use of a variety of metaphors to make sure the user does know what to do and investigate specific elements of the page. I decided to make sure the user does not get overloaded in the process, therefore there are exactly the right amount of elements, so that in merely 3 minutes anyone can get to know me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the funny thing, I managed to create this project in 2 days with an extra day spent on fixing small issues and optimising performance. I might clean the code later on to make sure anyone who inspects the code will actually be willing to take me onboard as a junior or graduate :P
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, I have tested it on a: PC, Laptop, Tablet, Smartphone and Smartwatch. It works well or very well on every single one. Although, the library has some performance-related issues on Edge browser.

    <p>I feel to explain this website I would have to create an entire thesis. It's not that I'm not willing to do this, the issue is how to do it well, as I don't even have a clear idea of how exactly my process looked like. But I guess I can say a few plain words on what motivated me to create this.</p>

    <p>
      And the motivation was very simple. Depressed by the overwhelming success of me getting into a Master program at an exchange university during my Bachelor course and the knowledge of me not knowing jack about what I was doing but still dedicated to making sure I can actually be ablebodied to design and develop, I decided to complement all of my previous work and host it entirely in one portal, so I could have a good idea of what I can and cannot do.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, the website did start being created in pain. It took an entire month for me driven in parallel with tough courses at LMU for me to create a pure base with additional subpages. I ran into so many issues along the way that it wasn't until I came back to Australia, when I managed to get most of my work online but the entire thing remained an averagely digestive mess. However, with coming months I did get ahold of more resources and knowledge, as of how easy it is to modify the rendering of simple markups. And considering I was relatively consistent with my html, I could easily implement globally features that managed to introduce a whole bit of life, as I would put into words. Animations, 3D effects and more. It's not all there yet but I managed to craft a variety and showcase all here, reference whomever I needed to and just play around, as if it's my own sandbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      I plan on introducing a bit more fun in the coming months with javascript and additional js libraries and it's just extremely satisfying to watch how your vision comes into reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in the meantime you may inspect, literally almost every single project I have ever been involved in, in life.
