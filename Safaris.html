Herzlich Wilkommen! My name is Fuad Soudah, a 22 years old Design Computing graduate, currently studying Master's of Interaction Design at University of Sydney; exchanging at Parsons School of Design.
</p>
<p>
My areas of expertise features: User Experience, Interaction Design and Human-Computer Interaction. As of late, I synergically apply a wide range of knowledges whenever needed, encompassing more ground-up cognisance as Graphic Design, Video Montage and Web Development or bottom-down technical sciences as Information Visualization, Application Development and Physical Computing in order to deliver the most accommodating solutions. One hobby I persistently pursued throughout the years was running a detailed, extensive blog, recently enriched by compelling photography that I post-process and capture on my own. Development of rich, immersive and compelling virtual environments in Game Engines is a new virtue I am currently apprehending.

      Zoomonitor is a very confusing system. First of all, the case that the application 'downloads' to your web browser with no visible impact taking place. Secondly, the lack of ability to actually use the system for the purpose of actually monitoring animals and then the navigation with the website to actually introduce the records, it's extremely confusing. Also setting up the system and the need to use the admin mode as opposed to user mode, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. But it works and so I started doing the work.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I was watching a panda. The ethogramic research I was conducting was basically me watching a panda, in a lot of UX job cases the designer needs to perform observations. But performing observations on creatures sleeping does seem like a creepy activity. What if they were humans? I think it's in our nature to feel discomforted by such activity, just because of security, just because of predators whether of our own kind or animal-animal form. Just in this case, the creature - panda, was sleeping on the tree and I saw a lot of similarities and parallels to how humans do this activity too. And many questions have arisen: how many hours do pandas sleep? Did they actually sleep or try to sleep? As it would change positions frequently, I do that too when I'm trying to sleep and I can't. Eventually, the panda would stop doing this and you could sort of see it based on the breathing pattern which seemed slower now. 10-11 seconds. Humans also have different sleeping patterns that I do monitor even with my smartwatch, for instance the light, deep (motionless) and perhaps two others but the research seems to constantly shift in relation to how it really is (like the phases when we dream). I guess pandas dream as well? Although perhaps their phases change. The time it takes them to sleep also may be different. Their reasons to sleep on a tree as well and perhaps their limbs don't get stiff because of being suspended on the branches due to their physique? How could we improve the natural processes perfected by evolution though by designing what? This seems like a challenge and I like challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have created most of the observations by writing notes adjacently to me watching the panda, which I would turn fullscreen and to a smaller once I noticed some particular behaviour happening. I guess it's quite unfortunate that I would come across an animal to conduct ethogramy while an animal is sleeping but I guess at times there is not helping such situations. The notes I would then condense and upload the behaviour patterns to zoomonitor once I figured out how the portal works all in all.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was a bit surprised to see how slow everything was proceeding, although that radically changed with the introduction of more movements. One those take place it is significantly more difficult to notice every single element of what the animal is doing and instead you have to resort to recurrent or most apparent behaviour. The digital pen on screen method was taking a bit of time as compared to doing everything digitally by simultaneously watching the subject and writing about it whenever needed. Writing on a keyboard takes less time as is less physically demanding. Also, if I were to just purely spend time on doing the ethogram instead of writing the observations, I believe I would have missed a lot of details. Nevertheless, due to time constraints and especially in the field it is not easy to constantly write about what you perceive, therefore keeping strictly to just writing down certain behaviour ought to boost the productivity of the researcher. Ever since it is cold and doing an ethogram when it's cold is quite challenging, as in spending half an hour and annotating, freezing your fingers off as opposed to writing in gloves with human's manual abilities being quite limited I decided to consider humans and animals and while I was at dealing also with time constraints, I decided to write about the behaviour of Parsons students at the UC Building on the cafeteria level. I would do differently by moving the ethogram to warmer days and writing about an animal that is quite different compared to, well, humans, who we do although quite don't really know after all.

      My background is quite diverse and so are the disciplines I am imbued with. In regards to the latter, I am primarily entwined with Design and knowledges revolving around its spectrum, that walk into the spheres of Human-Computer Interaction, Art, Computer Science and many more, that originally report back to what the Design Process Entails, in fact, User Centered Design Process, one that is primarily driven by humans. If we were to adhere to humans as a form of animals, who share many traits and commonalities with animals that range and cover spectral of emotions, then in such case anthropomorphism in a way becomes a driving force of design. As what's most important in the design streams I was taught, is the fulfillment of human needs, directly and indrectly expressed, measured objectively and subjectively, quantified and interpreted via a variety of ways.</p>

      <p>In many cases, the results have to be interpreted and as humans who we are interpret them, we apply knowledges acquired beforehand, at times also resorting to 'hunches', something that humans have a feeling about but can't yet express exactly what is telling them and why, those hunches being one form of driving and justifying a design. One that is not necessarily accurate but can tell something as they originate from somewhere. If these hunches are treated as instincts, then without a doubt, instincts themselves are being shared between humans and animals and could be driven down to just simply relying to a set of senses, ones that we operated on, commonly-established set of five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste. These at times intersect with one another, for instance smell and taste, at times they will also become 'sharper', if for some reason some senses do not work well or at all, with documented instances of at least hearing becoming more precise once sight is decreased or lost altogether. Now, with animals, these senses can often be much stronger or weaker, whether in terms of hearing, this being able to detect a wider set of frequencies, or eyes being positioned more apart from one another, providing greater angle of view, like for eagles and letting them only see a certain set of colours, ideal for detecting prey. All senses, sharpened up throughout the years, becoming what they are, due to evolution and what one could possibly call - natural selection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing all this helps a designer to create better solutions. For once, by the use of metaphors that can involve animals, their tendencies and features of their sensory output. As in the paper, one could say a lot of Anthropodenial could be happening, as designers can take certain actions taken by animals literally, in a false manner when one shown behaviour may indicate a specific action that's being paralleled to what humans know but in fact mean something entirely different, known to people who deal with, especially one specific set of animals professionally. That doesn't mean that the design will be ultimately flawed if it's being ultimately designed for humans and the products designers get involved in are always being susceptible to change and iterations but showcasing specific phenomena is just something that designers ultimately just have to consider in order to strengthen and justify their designs and, design by metaphor, is from what I know, one of the strongest techniques to justify a design. If nature nurtured specific species and perfected them to be good at something, like eagles with their wide-angle and specific colour-spectrum vision enabling them to hunt down their prey, then perhaps humans could benefit, from, let's say, having a set of binoculars that cover wide angles and thermal-vision, which one could argue could be considered as one way, parallel to how specific animals see the world, see it whatever's useful to them and contributing to their own survival.
