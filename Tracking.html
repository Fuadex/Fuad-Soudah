    <center><h4>Introduction</h4></center>
<i>'From fitbit to apple watch, self tracking activities, movements, calories intake,... is becoming increasingly popular. The tracking self investigates the concept of self tracking, with a critical view towards quantified self. The tracking self project explores the possibility of designing personal wearable devices or apps that allow a better understanding of self, and create an opportunity for reflecting on personal behaviours such as physical activity, or self-regulating emotions.'</i><br><br>

Ever since we are living in the information era and smartphones became the communication device nr. 1, with a range of sensors and integrated circuits miniaturised to the point that every single, seemingly trifling data may be captured, the potential to form a larger picture and contribute to understanding oneself opens up, provided by the graduating openness of platforms and their willingness to share database resources via API, I am curious as to explore how a collective of datasets could potentially visualise, inform and in consequence educate and drive the enrichment of anyone's life.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Summary and next steps</h4></center>
    I'm looking forward to conducting a case study on wearables, the data they collect, its quality and use.<br>
    There is one wearable that I was in touch with over a year ago, which is Gear S3, a device meeting my expectations, although equipped with restrictions attached uniquely to the region it was sold in. I might be interested in conducting a case study with one particular device and analysing others more in theory, unless it would be possible to look at a variety in practice.<br><br>
    There are is a new wearable likely to appear tomorrow, Galaxy Watch, which may provide a glimpse on what has actually improved, especially in terms of the sensors and how a span of communities takes it in regard.<br><br>

    That having said, smartphones could be considered as wearables too. All of us carry them in a certain form. Even for fitness, special bands exist to carry them, for instance on your arm. Many will come equipped with a variety of sensors too, even a heartbeat sensor.<br><br>

    It would be interesting to look at other potential devices such as smartglasses or venture even more into the future, considering potential human augmentations that could take place, what artists have envisioned in the past and currently and other, existing formulas, such as apparel.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Retrospection - 9/08/2018</h4></center>
    Let's try to meet the general ideas of the research I'll be conducting a little bit more in detail. Sometime ago I had a smartwatch, I acquired Galaxy Gear S3 as it seemed that it just could be the smartwatch I needed. Furthermore, it was relatively cheap while I was on exchange in Germany, especially once considered I had acquired amazon vouchers after having attended user-testing sessions at LMU and the conditions attached to purchases in Germany were very lenient. If I was not happy with the product, then I could just simply return it, no questions asked, within a 30 day period. Eventually I did due to regional restrictions, for instance Samsung Pay was not present in Germany, therefore it was not available on my S3 and it would not become as such after having arrived in Australia, which I carefully verified before arriving back in Australia. None of it happened though, before I have put the device to a thorough test and traces of my tests are still saved on my phone.<br><br>

    Let's start with technical features of the smartwatch.<br><br>

    General overview:<br>
    - 32.9mm size<br>
    - 63g Weight<br>
    - 380 mAh battery<br>
    - 4GB memory<br>
    - NFC & MST<br>
    - Bluetooth v4.2<br>
    - Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ 2.4GHz<br>
    - GPS, Glonass<br>
    - IP68 Rating (basic waterproofness)<br><br>

    Sensors<br>
    - Accelerometer<br>
    - Barometer<br>
    - Gyroscope<br>
    - Heart-Rate Sensor<br>
    - Light Sensor<br><br>

    Now, disregarding most of the device's features, let's take a closer look at how does it record user activities, especially the ones that are triggered. For this, I have decided to showcase one of the first training sessions I have done with the device.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Cycling and Walking</h4></center>
    The device will record many activities by itself. However, in case of trainings triggered manually by the user, the device will collect the data more thoroughly and meticulously.<br><br>

    For instance, the first two screenshots showcase cycling that I have done on the 7th of July. It collates all the data from all my movements done on the day, presents with the distance I have done by myself, the longest time of my activity and the amount of burnt calories.<br><br>

    Let's take a look at the first training I did... interestingly at 7 pm, it might be an issue with how Samsung sorts the sessions. The exact route is presented on a map, including the stops that I have made due to traffic lights. There is a customisable chart of my speed, heart pulse and potentially altitude which was disabled here. More dynamic training is extracted. Each part of my journey is split into the time I have spent on those. And even more details are provided further down, such as:<br><br>

    - The time of the training and the total time of the training<br>
    - The distance I have covered<br>
    - The amount of calories burnt during the training and in total<br>
    - Average and max speeds<br>
    - Average and max tempo<br>
    - Lowest and highest altitudes<br>
    - The longest distance while I was climbing and descending<br>
    - Average and maximum pulse<br><br>

    In addition, weather details are presented, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. Additional pictures could be added... <b>and the data extracted as GPX</b>.<br><br>

    Now, as for the second training. That was conducted at midnight, it was pretty much my first test, as I decided to do some running around Munich's Olympic Village and Park. In this case the details recorded were fairly the same. Except, Some additional gamification features were included, as apparently I won some virtual trophies. The chart can also include cadence. The differences between the pacing is bit more vivid too and since the distances ran were lower, I could see a bit more detailed overview of how my route exactly looked like. <b>This information could be exported as GPX as well.</b><br><br>

  <center><h4>Heart Rate</h4></center>
    Now this is the most detailed part. It is particularly interesting as Samsung managed to find a few uses for this. During training, the heart rate would be continuously monitored. Outside however, it would collect the data roughly, every 20 minutes. At times more often, at times bit less. It would also attach an icon showcasing the activity being done, such as cycling or... sitting idle.<br><br>

    All the information would amount to an aggregate chart and technically could be of use for a doctor to look at. As the overall patterns would be showcased, although, it is only the heart rate. And there is the question of the sensor's accuracy.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Sleeping Patterns</h4></center>
    The extra feature was the monitoring of sleep. Normally, the any watch would likely be taken off before going to sleep. However, Samsung actually encourages to keep it on the wrist, as it could gather detailed information about your sleeping patterns. This worked fairly well, although the device had to be recharged every 2-4 days, depending on how much it was being used. It would gather the amount of hours slept, the performance of your sleep, how much time you really slept, how long you were motionless, how long you slept 'lightly', spent without sleeping and... how many calories you burnt in the process. You could also rate your sleeping patterns.<br><br>

  But that is quite fine, as I also worked on setting up a skeleton in my mind of how the research could be set up.<br><br>

  And so, the preliminary vision consists of a few elements:<br><br>

  - Researching <b>existing hardware, software and media</b> gathering various amounts of data and their impact on people's lives<br>
  - Researching <b>existing work focused around API</b>, predominantly precedent studies of works in Australia and hosted overseas<br>
  - Studying <b>people's behaviour and awareness</b> of what data they share and whether they use or are willing to use it in any form<br>
  - Finding out platforms that <b>offer API publicly</b> and finding ways of utilising the data it provides within foreset constrains<br>
  - Creating an application aggregating and <b>making use of publicly available APIs</b>, preferably based on social networks<br>
  - <b>Iterative User-Centered development</b> of the application and measuring changes occurring in users via iterative research<br><br>
