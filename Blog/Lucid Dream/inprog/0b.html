    Do you know this feeling, when you're sitting, in front of a tool. On one hand inert, the tool won't budge unless you do. On the other you are more than willing to budge but instead, you won't. With the state preserving for the continuity of a relative period and beyond, the term of which remains ambivalent and just as the predecesor, relative.<br><br>

    You don't? Well then, you're a happy bloke. Congratulations! You seem to have a achieved something fundamental in life. You do? Well then, it's a tough church to overcome this tight screw, ain't it? To think of it, there isn't much required or attached or anything, it's all pure imagination, the devil building all these fortresses of constraint. I'm quite good with coming up with entirely new ones. Popping the ones before with a simple touch, it's ridiculous how much you may achieve with as much but mine was of pure imagination. One that likes to revisit the old constructs.<br><br>

  <p>
    You probably didn't understand much of what I have just written up there, confused, you remained and were you now? This is just kinda how I do and survive in this world, sort of in my own defined constraints of existing and none at all, imagination and a bit beyond, conflicting at times but of sorts that I do not perceive as such at all. With the matter progressing towards the wrong direction, as I just read my introductory paragraph and I was like, I don't understand what I have written up there, especially that it was written and there for quite some time and I was looking forward to starting this in a completely different, seperate, more forthcoming and appropriate for all of you to read, way. Perhaps many authors survive in the minds of societies like this, not me but as I think as somehow many poets are such deconstructed through the lens of, whatever, geography, sexuality, the type of coffee they drink and words they use, based on cultural, anthropological and whatever sense that was made throughout the years.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I in fact intended to write was about my first, well, now it would be an entire week. But in a way, I feel as if it was already a month if not longer that has spanned. There are fortnights, so why not that I write that 2 monthlynight has surpassed or just half a year, 2 years or less. I don't truly know, the things I do, do not seem to be kept in an objective relevance. As they are all revolving and relativatised to extents that I am still trying to get a grasp on, despite I cannot and don't anymore. This is a land, not just of the free but of the contradictionary if not just plainly contradictory. Because it's not quite a land, if it is a state but not even just a state but a district, one that I do not really even live on but a bit further away, on an Island called Staten Island that not even Staten Islanders can explain why it is part of New York as it could've been of Jersey. And how much different it is from Manhattan, which is the New York everyone knows but as it consists of 5 districts and one large one, that is essentially a state and has a different system, taxes and such that I have not yet visited. As it turns out, even an own airport but most go to the one named after Kennedy. And perhaps I should pick up from there, because it will all go chaotic in no-time.
  </p>

  <p>
    And even before, as I departed from Sydney a little bit enclosed in my own head of having just discovered the sea and that I was living near the sea, truth to be told - a minimum of 2 hours away from the sea, so that's likely why I would be reluctant to go, as I had been concentrating on my studies. But once I realised that I won't be seeing much of my land down under, I guess I just figured it's time to go to sea, at times not going at times best suited for, when it was hot. Getting headaches from sweating excessively while enclosed between four walls, eventually I'd prefer to stay commuted rather than at my own home. One that over the years, I felt antagonistic towards, because there is nothing in Minto and there is nothing keeping me in Minto and from all the places I have visited around the world, this place was for me one of the worst to live in, even if it by all means could be considered as relatively comfortable living. And so living in Sydney was, under the system I was subjected to, where my expenditures were relatively low, a city extremely cosmopolitan to my standards. Now that I think about it, it still is, the Central Business district was quite big too and many things seemed on the right pole but once I started moving between cities, cultures, massive amounts of land and what I would soon discover as one really soon coming but so unexpected, a culture shock that is one of a kind.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Sydney was to be considered multicultural, then New York would define entirely new definitions of what multicultural is to mean. If I was to name it Cosmopolitan, Sydney is nothing compared to New York, this city and state is the ultimate form of cosmopolitan and what it truly is in fact, nothing that I have crossed against on my path was as diverse as New York is. Central Business District? I have visited massive cities on my way, one of the largest on this planet in fact, some extremely widespread and some others extremely widespread such as Beijing or Sydney, first that you could see from the plane spreading out to the horizon as a plain, sea of light at night. Sydney, being one itself but with the main skyscrapers located in its main CBD, although even if these are being conurbized, still I felt it as being massive. But once you see New York, this is a completely new definition of massive. On my way from the airport, true, mostly I'd be crossing under and over suburbs, one that I'd have to cross by a strange combination of commute to the subway, with the railway excluded from the subway system and the subway being old, unintuitive an intricate but showcasing all the suburbs far away and the array of people jumping in and out. And then Manhattan, with its landscape that I get to observe every morning and evening that I commute by ferry to, for free, charged in a weird transfer rate while I enter and leave the ferry of by accessing the subway - an entirely optional thing to do, costing 2.75$ for unlimited travel, until you hop off even after many transfers and just going out the gate. With the subways being as economic as possible, tight, squeezed, with not much room and convenience for any people with disadvantages, you can imagine how carrying 3 pieces of luggage across the city resulted in excessive muscle pains keeping up for, surprisingly, just a week-long, of about with me carrying over 40kg at times (that's more than half of what I weigh!).

  <center><h4>Contradicting Further</h4></center>
    
  <p>
    I usually take changes without that much of a hassle, just getting hit mentally but not physically. The first thing did arrive eventually, perhaps not in Hawaii over which I transferred, where I was subjected to a thorough secondary inspection, where I had to list names of people I know in the us, state what I was doing in certain countries I've visited such as Jordan or Turkey (with the latter visited over 5 years ago!), my social media accounts and other stuff. Me buying an IPA at the airport to get change for 11$ and taking a bus supposingly taking me to Honolulu but which took me to a military base, from which I was redirected to another bus stop but as the buses were rarely passing through here I had to take a 15 minute hike to take another bus taking off from a bus stop further away. And I would have taken the right bus if only I had change, for which I have waited for quite some time already. Me ending up eventually in Honolulu on an overcrowded bus, seeing it for literally 5 minutes, going back to the airport and discovering a massive line to security. Being redirected to a much shorter line further away, seeing that US doesn't like security features of Manila airport and then going shortly away by checking into the next plane, on which they would not serve beers as part of what I paid for, despite I had a beer on my way from Sydney to Honolulu. Are you getting confused already? Hey, it's like saying Sydney is big. It's not, once you arrive in New York.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a melting pot of special sort. The array of people you'll come across is as striking as nothing else that I have experienced of up to date. Which is partially in line with how I planned my visited, well equipped, not establishing any expectations beforehand, willing to just see everything as it appears in front of my eyes and just then starting to establish parallels, metaphors and subjecting all to my own knowledge and complementing it in the process. And so, everyone as in everyone is as vibrant as it gets. But at the same time, the vibrance at times can be comparable to what I'd see in Poland during winter, therefore not vibrant at all. On my way to Staten Island I'd see, that everyone's coats are just dark, in shades of black and alike colour forms. But unlike as how I'd remember people commuting in Poland and being all in these darker clothing, here people would seem much more talkative and social. Within the city, it gets a bit different and more colorful, to a certain extent. It's a very weird feeling at times as it could mean that I am in fact looking as if one of the richer people around, which should absolutely not be the case. But it is to a certain extent, the outlook, with the clothes I wear and especially the equipment I travelled into the country. It's feeling extreme a bit and at times and I feel a bit at an unease once I think that I live at a place, in a basement, to which anyone could break into and nobody is for a number of reasons: nobody knows me, many won't know the value of the equipment I came into the country with, many of the places around Staten Island look exactly in the same form, worn down, as if frozen in time and with me writing the very next words, I feel I'd love to write much much more and elaborate if further. And I'll just do it that way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once upon a time I was told, that if I want to see a place that froze in time, I'll need to travel to Cuba. And I'd need to travel fast. Well, you don't have to travel either fast or that far at all, all you need is to get a plane ticket and get over to New York and not even just Staten Island, which may be considered as my classic example of how a city froze in time. I live by a street, where every single building was built by a family that hired a different architect. And each is built in a way that I feel I might have never ever seen in my life, with cylindrical forms and a multitude, ridiculous amount of rooms enbuilt into these what I would call as villas. Some of these buildings, I swear, I've seen only while playing video games, as such as The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and alike. I'd restrain myself from saying this is like a fairytale architecture but all of this experienced in a week does feel like a dreamy dream, lucid dream, one that I still make subconscious attempts at apprehending and comprehending but with me failing miserably because the only way to approach it is by just being, as if a conscious and conscienscious animal living in a habitat which I'd consider the ultimate jungle construct established by humans. You'd see an afroamerican lady tripping over nothing over a sidewalk, after helping whom you'd hear from her that she owes you hamburgers. You'd come across a hispanic, walking past every single person on the street and saying god bless you in a very distinct accent. And I'm mentioning race, which I usually refrain from doing just for one simple reason: have you seen all those american movies and the strong accents people would be using? People here talk EXACTLY like in these movies and I'm not joking. You will identify Italians, Russians, Mexicans and many other nations just purely based on the very strong and distinct accent they use their English with. But at the same time, many of the people you'll come across with be multilingual which will not be dependent on race at all, with the accent being not apparent, in terms of Spanish at least, a language I cannot really comment on as I just don't know it well (still I commented on it, right? Eh...).
  </p>

<p>
  But as I identified all these different accents and how people speak, I started noticing something else too. In Europe, you'll come across many monoethnic countries such as Poland but also to some extent, multiethnic as well, such as France or Germany. But the multiethnicity there or even in Australia, felt a bit different, as in much more unified, as in many in a way growing up in the very same communities, which is true to only some extent. But here in America, it all seems radically different, at least in New York. The afroamerican, mexican, british descendents american (is there a better single word?), all communicate in a very, as I'd say, endemic way that I'd argue is very, very distinct to not just upbringing but the education system and I see that the city's government is doing heaps and pushing a massive effort forward to alleviate it all. In Europe I remember seeing the ideas of multiculturalism and bridging it all ridiculed by at least many associating themselves with the right wing political spectrum. But the thing is, now that I see how it looks like in America, it feels as if in Europe there are many who are trying to apply American solutions and vice versa. The differences and discrepancies here in NY are massive and you see it all straightaway. But also the interesting thing is, despite such huge mountains of differences being spotted and me saying how many of this looks the same and vibrant, it is truly vibrant and in fact, despite it might not really feel that way in some areas just due to how the areas look like, the buildings, the infrastructure and all, even some people who could look shady, it all feels incredibly safe. There is also a massive police presence at many areas around NY and they seem, despite the outlook I established from learning based on news and such, very pro-citizen, not caring about people prevalently jaywalking because everyone jaywalks. Intervening only when it's absolutely necessary and actually talking to one another in a bantery way, I'd been hearing some of them swearing as well, with many new yorkers swearing, talking in distinct jargons. A lot of mental models that I had, there is no application for them here, because in many cases no models kinda exist, just individuals and some clusters but even that is not true because here I felt very welcome overall, in fact, to such an extent that I have not seen anywhere. People introducing themselves, giving advice and being very pleasant. Strangers too. With me upon arriving in the city and looking for a place to eat, one person stopped on the street, asked if I was lost and then said there's a good brasilian cafe nearby. After 2-3 hours of spending time there, waiting with all my luggage to attend my first class due to me needing to commute all the way to staten island and not having enough time to do a round-trip, I have later come across on my way to class in the elevator the same person who recommended me the place, briefly joking around about the weather that it's usually not that bad (- temperatures and high humidity).

  <center><h4>Alleviating Contraditions</h4></center>
    
  <p>
    There is a flood of everything from everywhere, crashing and overwhelming my mind at times. By an accident finding Times Square on my way to Museum of Modern Art, which is free of charge for Newschool students, normally you'd have to pay around 20$. And NY in the end is actually more expensive than Sydney, which is already considered as an expensive city. New York might even not be that bad, except that you have to pitch in 10-15% for the service and add 8.875% GST tax, which is most of the cases, not counted in towards the price listed. In many cases the products there will not be descriptive, therefore there will be no assurance whether the orange juice you're about to drink is actually pure orange juice until you've actually tasted it. In Australia and actually in most cases anywhere around Europe, you'll see percentages and precise naming of the ingredients like orange juice or orange juice from concentrate in such propotions. But not in the US, with the actual data being concealed to some extent most of the time but the pricing confusing and the products themselves not sorted in a properly fashion either. The grocery stores will most of the time be old and extremely chaotically arranged, coffee will be placed in hot pots made from a drip instead of a machine, many pre-prepared foods like salads and meat will look so bad, that most of these joints would be closed tight shut in Poland. The juices aforementioned, would be also placed all around the store. Instead just in one aile with other juices, these would be refrigirated in many different refrigirators and located at a variety of ailes. Where's the logic? Don't ask. There's none. Along with me, trying to figure out the local products, because I hardly know any here. In fact, around 90% of the products around here I just simply do not know. You'd figure, coca cola, pepsi? Yes, it's here. I remember Dr Pepper being introduced in Poland and me liking it. But absolutely most products that I find on the shelves in America, I cannot begin to figure out what I am actually buying. And in the end I would not eat too much overall in my first days of being here, in the end I think I lost a few kilos (just a bit down to 74, which I was frankly happy to see but I did not see a change in physical appearance so idk).
</p>

<p>
  I focused on trying a variety of things. Let's stick to food. I was absolutely torn and blazed away at first once I tried New York's pizza. Just simply because I came to a realization that this pizza is actually better than the ones I tasted in Italy. The crust being distinctly crunchy, the cheese in its own way too and melting away with it all, the taste of, and with and of the dough and it as a slice being incredibly filling. The taste being so good and then trying other things. McDonald's tastes exactly the same + is more expensive than elsewhere. But they have other fastfoods in America and NY. Wendy's is a good example, of a place that does actually really filling and solid burgers, affordable too. I tried a hotdog from a shopping cart that was great as well, with the bun being really soft, the ketchup tasting very much like tomatoes and the sausage being really crunchy and tasting like an actual and good sausage. The friest that came with, were very soft and, now from the time passing, I could just describe them as tasty, I'd say they had a texture, let's say that was uniform, these fries were different but great with each bite I took during one of these cold, New Yorky days. I tried something else from yet another shopping cart that sells gyros, kebabs, falafels and... a philly cheesesteak which I had to try as a friend recommended. Which is essentially, what seemed like kebab metal with these cheese slices you can get from a supermarket, with each slice being foiled up. These two, sliced up, fried and thrown on top of some salad like lettuce and tomato slices. The bun was soft again, the meat was distinct with the cheese, dripping with a mix of quite spicy and other not so spicy sauce combination. A solid portion of fuel that kept me going for the rest of the evening. The other time when I had a headache, I returned home after taking 3 pills of aspirin... you're asking why so many? Because each pill had like 83mg of aspirin and a pack had 32 of those. They didn't have paracetamol. Why was there no paracetamol? Idk. Also, at that pharmacy I have bought an international power charger for 15$, 10$ cheaper and I was referred by a lady at Best Buy store that operates 24/7. In addition, at these pharmacies you can buy anything, like water, biscuits, whatever, they had everything. And it's part of the Newschool's new building on the base floor. Either way, on my way back I had a Burrito, which was so soft... so soft, that it almost sounds perverted. With the meat, the wrap and the rest of ingredients just melting away and a bottle of Sangria, which was not Sangria in its traiditonal sense, as in it had no alcohol, it was not wine, it was carbonated and had a very distinct taste that I'd call as coca-cola but with a much richer spice palette. That's one of the problems, that I have, that I should be writing about it all as I go but I have no time as I keep on exploring and dedicating my time to learning stuff but there is just so much stuff happening and I feel bad for listening music on my way during commuting and walking around because there is just simply so much interesting stuff happening, just the vibrance of the city is incredibly stunning, people speaking and the topics they're broaching and the way they're speaking n' all. Vibrance, vibrance, vibrance.

  Another time I was passing by Chinatown and that was yet another interesting experience as it looked very similar to a town that I'd call felt like a Japanese district. Perhaps it was. I don't know. Apparently many districts are endemically occupied by specific ethnicities. Just as greenpoint in NY will be prevalently Polish. There is Little Italy and as mentioned Chinatown, which looked like Japan depicted in Man in The High Castle on Amazon Prime. Let's hop around: I drank cold pressed mix of Mint, Pineapple, Lemon and I think lime juices but it felt as if there was something spicy in it. Weird, right? Chia Latte costs 5$ but my breakfast without it cost like 3$. Cup of coffee can cost as little as 2.5$ or 4.5$. A slice of bread can cost like less than 1$, 2.5$ or even 5$. A bottle of juice can cost like less than a 1$, 2.5$, 5$ or 10$. Most of the time the food will be very high quality, at times it can be just good or really good. I tried milk bar, apparently famous, now it is due to being on Netflix's Chef's Table, a softserve tasting, what I've seen in the documentary, as milk favoured with cereal, a slice of cake called a crack pie, which was literally a massive combo of sugar, carmelised but in a very distinct and good way. Also, most of what's sold in NY, is sold with calories shown explicitly, which is actually quite cool imho. The distances here in the city are overwhelming, on a map it doesn't seem like much but for instance it takes me over 15 minutes to walk to the ferry and I figured i'd be like 5 just purely depending on google maps. Google Maps at times malfunction, for instance it says I need over 2 hours to get to Jersey, which shows a route all around instead of just a fraction that I could take, just by getting near a bridge and crossing it. I have also tasted a pretty decent Ramen, from yet another place that apparently was shown on Netflix, with the ingredients being amazing but a a whole, just fine. I also realised something there, as sake had listed flavours that are derived from it, which are far from what one would expect after alcohol. I realised, it's the same case with coffee, with beers, wine, whisky. It's as if people in this world at times, start eating and drinking things that in fact and in the end taste like something completely else. I didn't do much fine dining but in this case the matters seem to be taken even further, as where stories are told by food, feelings conveyed and emotions evoked. But I'm not rich.

    Sleeping in NY is a bit of an issue for me. Jetlag is a classic and I know how to get that fixed however I could not do a classic reset by just going and having a couple of drinks, at least for the first almost a week. Then, once I started living on my own, I could not do the reset because I just simply do not tend to drink by myself, as I kind of frown upon this as an activity to be done by yourself, as in intoxicating oneself. So as a result, I'd go to sleep around 8 pm, wake up at 2, not be able to sleep for the next couple of hours and hit the bed again. The day I had a headache I went to sleep at 3 pm, woke up at 8, worked for a bit, hit the bed again, woke up at midnight, worked for 2-3 hours, hit the bed again and woke up at 6, at which pointed I just prepared myself to go to school and did a bit of more of the 100 pages of readings I had to do until the class, which I naturally did not manage to complete. I did perhaps around 30 + a video. And finished writing a 1000 words paper, which I felt was quite mixed/terrible. The preceding day we had a wonderful lecture but I could not pay attention to due to my headache, about anthropology and stuff, that I had to read around 20 interesting pages. I also got a duck tape duct tape and there was one more interesting lecture in our Design for Safaris course, which is just simply incredibly challenging but looking really good. The guy teaching has a background at MIT, Microsoft and other companies, I don't remember others, there is just simply so much happening everywhere and everywhere that it's difficult to keep track of what's going on.</p>

      The expenditures around NY are ridiculous. I already mentioned how expensive it is and how varied it is but at times it gets really ridiculous. I ate 2 bagels the other day for around 2.5$ but just today and it only merely mid-day, I've managed to squander around 50$ on commuting and food, and drinks. Many students use a tool called MealPal, which provides lunches of 6.5$ but I also want to explore and try a variety of different things like a terrible bottle of coconut juice infused with erithritol and pineapple juice with just merely 10% of coconut water, so it was terrible. I tried however a good bottle of sparkling yerba mate with no sugar, I tried a scramble of white eggs which is an option next to scramble of yellow eggs, tofu mixed with vegetables that are served on weird long and thin plates. There are sections, as chefs serve many foods like omlettes, freshly pressed juices. There are fruit salads in the morning and normal salads in the afternoon. Pizzas are served in the afternoon and there are slices or cakes and such which cost 5$, with slices of bread served in the morning for a bit less than 2.5$. There is a market happening on Union Square where I take off and where there is an intersection between Parsons and NYU students hovering around. Sometimes you notice a large distinction in terms of the students themselves as how they differ compared to other students, sometimes you don't (idk what it depends on). NYU has also a large shop, where you can buy anything with NYU initials on it and a large selection of clothes colored distinctly in, probably, NYU colours. Just figured I should mentioned all of that. I might also start commuting to the classes by a bicycle. It's funny, it's like back to the past and the future but as the ferrys are for free, the bike can be too. I'd be saving at least 5.5$ per day, that like a bit like a cup of coffee and a half. And I do need my coffees, just I'm a bit concerned about the amount of jaywalking happening, as I loooove to use my bicycle in a rapid, hectic and at times also dangerous manner. But as I'm in NY, I guess I'll have some leeway legal-wise.

      I'm still waiting to get appropriate documents to apply for a NYCID, so that I could attend all the museums for free (For a year I believe?). At the moments it's just Museum of Modern Art and Rubin's Museum (?) of Art (?), which I'll be visiting shortly. I've seen part of Central Park which is cool. I took a ride to Upper Manhattan and noticed all the bridges and buildings which gave me a strong feeling of just how much industrial this city is and how it exceeds all the definitions of industrial that I had up-to before I landed in New York. As you can see there's a lot of confusement going on. For instance I was not assigned housing at first, then I was but I already said no. I'd be paying 2.5k $ for a month, which is ridiculous for any standards and I had to forfeit 350$ of just me signing up. Instead I settled for an option of my mother knowing someone who knows someone on Staten Island. I was told that I'd pay as much as I can. Then I settled that my mom with settle this. And now I don't know how much it'll be, in the end I am living in a basement and was treated more like a guest. Lots of uncertainty that became just kind of certain. But now as it all have emerged and I kind of started settling, I am starting to feel sort of overwhelmed, surrounded and becoming just defensive and a bit of myself that I do not quite necessarily enjoy or like. I kind of liked my first days of just taking it all directly, asking questions, being a bit more free, one of the domains I wanted to establish, as in being as free as possible, unconstrained primarily by myself and the environments. At a point, it all becomes a bit too much, surrounding and clustering, just mentally I'm becoming incapacitated. Which ain't nice at all.

    One last thing maybe I'll write about. It seems that with all this vibrance you'll come across all the possible and impossible. In other words, think like of things that you cannot come across. You can be almost certain this will happen in NY. Thinking someone would have never been in touch with calculus? Here in NY, that's possible. 11th grader knowing python? Here in NY. Pizza better than in Italy? Here in NY. Going to the uni by ferry? Here in NY. Not knowing anything about anything and trying to figure it all out, here in NY?
</p>

<p>
  Also just recognising all the sights and stuff that you have seen previously in video games or the movies. All feel so surreal. I even wanted to document this all from the perspective of me just hitting a place and saying 'oh, sopranos, kevin lost in ny etc.'. But at some point you realise, that this city is just so full of every single thing. And there is no way for you to see it all. So you gotta make the best of your time in the way that you feel is most appropriate for you. This becomes a challenge at a point. One quite massive.

  And many of the places being so old. And not modern at all. And me not being able to pay for stuff with NFC but MST. And having everything cost extra with the GST, even online services. The typography being very inadequate. Many of the place worn down. Oh man, where do I begin, where do I end, how do I cope, how do I everything. They even have more music on google play music here. And Spotify comes with Hulu for students. People, students introduce themselves to me, academics too. Many not knowing me as I am a bit like from another dimension.

  I also thought about installing mealpal, which treated me to think I can eat under 6$ a day. The reviews look bad, though.

  Passing by the statue of Liberty every time I go and return home is pretty cool.
