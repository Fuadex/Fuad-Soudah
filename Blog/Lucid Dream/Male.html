      Maldives' capital is Male. And basically, it is an Island. Verrry densely populated with people and buildings altogether. But it is a small island and technically, you should be able to get anywhere by foot. Even the airport but there are ferries for those. You know, think of, the length of and island equal to where my family is in Poland and how close it is to my favourite hypermarket there. I mean, it ain't close. It's like 3.5 km, so it takes about less than an hour to get there, like 40-45 minutes. That is the same time you'd need to get from one point on this island to the other.</p>

<p>However, unlike any other European especially country, which would get on with placing bikes in the middle, cause it is just so damn close to everywhere, these folks decided to go around by, primarily, scooters. And they're freaking everywhere. As in, so everywhere, that it's pure chaos on the streets, which get clogged constantly and at times it is even difficult to go by foot cause suddenly, a taxi wants to go through.

      I wish there was some sort of device that would save the tastes you flavour and savour, the one that you wish you could remember till the end of times because it is so good but at the same time you know you will end up forgetting it.</p>

<p>This drink is a sort of coffee-based drink I stumbled upon while in Male. The only thing it said in the menu, was that it is a coffee-based drink with these kinds of flavours. I asked like, what is this position.</p>

<p>I was explained again:</p>

  <p>- 'xxx' is a coffee-based drink</p>

<p>So I looked at the lady with a tattoo on her well-built arm, gazingly with an expression one could illustrate as awaiting more information, as this tells me nothing.</p>

  <p>- ...bla bla bla, don't remember. Something with coffee, a bit of tonic (?), some juice (lime? Lemon?), rose petals, some syrup (??? Rose????) and a bit of nitro (liquid nitrogen).</p>

<p>It took a while for the coffee to get prepared, primarily due to the line of people scattered across the cafe. Next to me were two girls talking in English, next to me a couple of middle-aged men talking about coffee, at least one of the themes. In the end, it was like, something about cold brew and something about aeropress. I always get wondered by how people in some countries are able to speak fluently in one language and then add up a word or a couple of English but also saying it, well, flawlessly and with an impeccable English accent.</p>

<p>This coffee-based drink is unlike anything I've tried before. They should really start bottling it and exporting as a national treasure. I taste peaches, melon and something very refreshing in the background. Perhaps a hint of apricot (I know it ain't there). It's as if it's got a bit of honey and I think I tasted mint... Oh no, it was in the pesto sandwich which was also phenomenal.</p>

<p>I recall it had also a foam, which I believe was made with coconut foam. I don't know how coconut foam is made, I know it doesn't taste like anything, though. Which is kinda sad. But the drink itself, freakin amazing and so refreshing. And yeah, sweet too but doesn't really kill the flavour. And the aroma...</p>

<p>It's also prepared and provided in a sort of a champagne glass. Interesting, they don't sell alcohol altogether in Maldives, unless it's not the core, as if you're bound to spend time on a privately owned Island.</p>

<p>It's quite interesting to learn how you go somewhere and some things that you think are unchangeable, are just that, here and there. It's about standards and then you see there kinda ain't none.</p>

    <center><h4>Critical Dillema</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      Imagine, a cup of wine but without alcohol, you niff it and it smells like coffee with a strong sweet lemony and melony... </p>

<p>...going back to the topic! It's not my position to criticize the locals, they can go around however they want. But, you know, it's a little strange thinking how are all those folks really doing and getting around, especially with waste. If you can really get from point A to B so fast, there is no point in having even automobiles. Better yet, why not have them but also electrical and even better - as part of a sharing system? It's perfect! Maldives can afford it. You know, even Venice does not look as great and feel so eco-friendly. Especially the damn rivers. Maldives seem the opposite except for all the vehicles. Get bicycles, even electric scooters and/or some other formulas. I mean, isn't it expensive to import fuel?</p>

<p>The coffee, though, holy sheet.</p>

<p>Geiko - Delicate, floral, sweet</p>

<p>Iced tea with kick of seasonal fruits<br>
Tarty sour iced tea<br>
Coconut water infused with thyme<br>
Dried coffee cherries infused with herbs and spices<br>
Cold water infused chamomile flowers with apple cider, cinnamon and pomegranade</p>

<p>Gicherori AB Kenya - Peach, black tea, green apple<br>
Fazenda Jerrado Brasil - Honey, white sugar, prune, biscuit<br>
Tarime wamacu Tanzania - Stone apples, earthy, rounded body</p>

<p>And my drink is being flamed on top, the foam that is</p>

<p>I was actually told what I was drinking.<br>
First, there is some sort of fruit called -sop. It's freshly made and tropical.<br>
Then there is rose water. Apparently, they tried 10 different kinds and the one they made and found was best.<br>
Then obviously the coffee. It's the roast and preparation.<br>
Obviously, there is also liquid nitrogen.<br>
And coconut water that is foamed.<br>
And this foam is also toasted with a gas torch.<br>
And rose petals spritzed all over, in a form to be what it is.</p>

<p>I actually ordered a second one, although beforehand I had ordered some other form, a banana whatever. It was served quite nicely, I mean, on one hand coffee with ice on the other the coconut milk with foam and some sort of a nutty truffle of sorts. It was fine. Not my type. There was also something about a banana, whatever.

<p>
 Then I got the thing I had before. And I gotta tell you, it wasn't as magnificent as the first batch I had. The problem was, many of the aromas and flavours were missing. And the depth. Nevertheless, I asked the barista and praised his creation. He also told me it is a guy he knows that came up with this after spending some time in Thailand and then obviously experimenting with the propotions and such. Also, it is all about the coffee and the proportions again. Once I have taken a look at their roasts, the flavours I was tasting - they suddenly all made sense. The peach came from Kenya and one hint I could not quite classify was the easiest in the world - green apple. Honey, I got this one and not apricots but prunes. Prune, it was definitely there. Rounded body sounds strange, I can't detect this kind of microcosms, whethere it was earthy or there were stone apples, whatever. There definitely was a bit of a mix and I tasted black tea in some way too.</p>

<p>I mean, people experimented with coffee for generations. Apparently a revolution came in years preceding. But I haven't tasted anything alike and the description didn't entice me either. I mean, what, coffee-based beverage? What I got and then tasted, ohhh man woman bi metro holy coffee. I mean, Male isn't special, it is kind of nice and so far kinda great once you consider what I came through. All those countries in the verticle sort: New Delhi, Colombo, Male. I mean, they are all alike. Not the same but still alike. A bit different religions but not that radically different back in the time? I think I'm generalizing way too much here and people will throw shit at me. But in a way, they all are kinda adjacent, with Male being the most civil, I mean the more south you get the more well-rounded it got.</p>

<p>It's just, there is still chaos on the streets but they will kinda try to run over you a bit less and definitely take off the gas when they see you. There will still be a few people bothering you for idk taxi or whatever but these will be singular cases. Male runs on tourists and so do Maldives and people here, even working - they know it. Although some still will entice you to buy stuff but Male is mostly for locals in the end. There will also be some people scanning you with their eyes but significantly less here in Male compared to its predecessors. I'm serious, it all went significantly lesser and here, it feels a bit more genuine all of a sudden, without people trying to scam you. It might be also something about the religion to but... I mean, when I think about it...</p>

<p>I believe religion actually has quite something to introduce here. See, there are all these spectra. New Delhi, I guess, Hinduism, Sri Lanka actually Christians but also Buddhists and Maldives, they are Muslim. It is so interesting to see how it all became quite mixed up all in the process. See in New Delhi, I don't know anything about Hinduism, except, I didn't really see too much following any sort of logic or moral etiquette in Delhi to begin with. So I'll drop ball on that. Sri Lanka is an interesting case, yeah Christians Buddhists band of course, Muslims at north who were stirring crazy shit and making the country unliveable, ever since someone came up with the concept of suicide bombing and yeah, security checks are all over. But I'm about here for the customs. I mean, women can be found here often in not so much of clothing, to some civilized manner but still - perfectly okay for Christians and... Buddhists? Anyway, getting confused now. But now I'm in Maldives and I see people swimming in their entire clothing I mean, fuck me, I heard of this but could not quite believe it. And then I saw plastic bottles in the water. In fucking paradise, they fucking trash it. And then bathe in full clothing. I'm like, fuck I'm not going into this water.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll come across women in niqabs and hijabs but also quite surprisingly, many without strictly adhering to the 'muslim clothing etiquette'. Some also in skirts but not so many. A woman with a tattoo on her arm as well at the cafe I was in. Working adjacently to a woman in a hijab, meeting probably her male friends and hugging them, perhaps not quite affectionately but still. I go out, oh they're calling for prayers. But people don't seem in a hurry. In fact, they are not at all. They are going on with their lives and not so many were entering mosques. Also, on one TV channel I've seen Ballentine's advertised. Alcohol is not sold in Maldives. So many conflicting things.

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      A few words about sports. Upon entering Male I was actually quite amazed with how narrow streets there were. And how cheap it kinda was. And then I saw also some people playing some weird game I have not seen by flicking pieces on a board. Now I am at the airport. And they were some thing popping up. A rock concert running for quite a bit by an Asian rock band. Then some Criquette. And then, holy shit, Premiere League and whoever's left at the airport. Hindi, Mali, flight attendants, police officers, they're watching. To speak of an experience binding cultures and generations. Amazing.</p>

<p>I mean, Male is not a special place. In fact, this is a country that you'll go to, only and solely for the purpose of going for a holiday but only to a resort. A private resort. One you'll need a speedboat or a water plane to get to. The hotel I was in, which was an inn actually, wasn't that bad. I had some problems with finding a good place and eventually I booked this last-minute which was a good decision, although a bit stressful one. Basically I put forward a bit more money but I received the bang for the buck - taxi all the way to the place and from the hotel to the airport at the place's cost. I got breakfast, which was a set of take what you need: fried eggs, sausages, broccoli, some pastries, fruits etc. I got a refill and some coffee. Also you had a coffee machine in the place and tea and bottles of water, all complimentary. All this, for a bit like 70U$. I felt like it was a good decision in the end. Although I feel I should have booked something else, also had wifi and the luggage carried which was unexpected. Got wifi. And the other complimentary stuff, I mean it was literally a 4-star hotel. Perhaps 3 but on the verge of being a 4. And I got my sleep. 7.5 hours. That's a lifesaver, trust me folks on this one.</p>

<p>One of the last problems that I am standing in front of, is my condition. Usually when I assemble my travel puzzle pieces I don't really take under consideration the fact that me, as any other person, can fall ill. I mean, obviously there are the hazard of eating in Delhi or getting some forms of malaria etc. But what I usually don't really take seriously is my condition to just fall ill and it all starts from dust. I started feeling a bit off while in Poland and then for serious in Helsinki, although it got better. Eventually, perhaps the large rollercoaster of AC and humid heat decided to stir shit in my body and in the end, at the airport, I am basically inept a bit. As in, sneezing, yellow phlegm. Kinda standard and the funniest part - it always gets to me at least once or twice a year. It's great that I decided to cut short my trip, hehe, as shorter it gets I mean, by having a shorter transfer in Kuala Lumpur. This way I will be able to get home faster but at the same time, there are hazard associated - cold aircraft's AC, the need for food and water. Basically I won't end up seeing anything in KUL but perhaps I'll be able to go to sleep faster. That's what I'm counting on. It's good that they had showers at Male's airport, this way I was able to get off all this sweat that I've accumulated in hectolitres while stumbling through Male. That probably also contributed negatively. Oh well.</p>

<p>Being deprived of sleep creates very interesting cognitive patterns. At times you'd feel as if you've seen something, like a mild form of -nesia kicks in. Also, listening to music makes you realize, that it is kind of deprived a bit of bass. Tonal environment and reception is especially interesting.</p>

<p>And UFC is running.<br>
