    <center><h4>Seoul</h4></center>
    Writing impressions of an over full day trip in which I have walked over 45 km, with a little bit of breakfast and no caffeine, nor electrolytes pumped into my system may be quite challenging, nevertheless, I'll trace my steps back to when I actually decided to actually do this trip. In the evening before I travelled, I had booked a flexible 4-day train ticket, covering high-speed trains (KTX). I had also purchased a sim-card for 30 days, despite I really don't need it for that long. These expenses were done literally last-minute, after which I grabbed a beer, had a chat with a friend, broke a soju bottle, took a shower and went to sleep. Then I woke up before my alarm kicked in and, okay, time to go.<br><br>

  </div><br>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Welcoming Party</h4></center>
    
    <p>The use of the flexible KTX ticket was relatively straightforward. I had to print the pass itself, though, which I'm finding ridiculous. Here I'm planning on travelling by a high-speed train and I'm required to print a pass that just really comes down to information about me, some rules and a QR Code? This just feels like bad user experience. In theory I could have just provided a PDF on my smartphone but the requirement is clearly stated on Korail Pass's website, which by the way, is at times quite ambiguous in terms of the rules. I'm starting to understand why do many Koreans, including Professors, do not speak English well, not just particularly mentioning the pronunciation which can be difficult to grasp but the structural form of the language that is just often unpolished, unrefined, vague and at times just wrong. That having said, I popped up at the station, asked for the next train to Seoul and in a few minutes I was on my way to Seoul.</p>

    <p>Now, another thing, the KTX itself. South Korea without any doubt, is a beautiful country. And so does the trainline provide a magnificent view covering large distances, often unobstructed by unsatisfactory weather conditions. What is even more compelling is how highrises pop up in clusters out of nowhere, in the middle of fields. This is something to criticise actually but the perspective is certainly, highly distinct. Despite, that the urbanisation takes place chaotically and in my opinion without consideration for the quality of life of the dwellers, the view of hills covered in forests, uniform green fields, seas of concrete poured to connect cities and towns, these are miles of roads and supporting infrastructure with urbanised scape blended into the picture. Such, appearing recurrently and just as gorgeous as before. And I have probably mentioned in one of my previous blogs, that they build the train stations in this country as if they were to blend into the structures some form of stadiums for masses. It's not always the case and it could be an exaggeration but after I have seen a few of these places in Asia, I kind of wonder, exactly how much does it take to raise those accompanied by the railtracks and supporting infrastructure. They're still very raw and it often feels empty inside but they're definitely built to withstand much, keep lots of people within and probably handle a much larger population.</p>

    <p>The trains on the other hand are something else. And that is something that prompts me to think about something completely else again indeed. Now when I do travels, I usually tend to associate what I see with other places that I have been to. I make connotations and I feel this is completely natural. Many will travel for a myriad of reasons and experience places in their own ways, each to their own. I prefer taking the analytical approach as I believe, that gaining experience from my travels and taking an analytical approach will benefit in some ways the work that I will conduct in the future. So, in this instance, the KTX train. I would assume there are many different carriages and in fact, these are not bad carriages. But they certainly do have some ways in which those could be improved. I didn't want to make too many remarks but after having travelled three times in trains that were literally the same, I guess I should name what I did indeed see. There is some space for luggage overhead. There are toilets. There is wifi, which gets heavily congested once many people get packed into the train. In some cases, they will make the train longer, that is amount the carriages to... was it around 20, with which I was travelling back to Daejeon? The windows are large enough to enjoy what's outside. And the seats are reasonably comfortable. There are also some TVs installed, which showcase a variety of advertisements and also strange animations. And the trains are also nicely soundproofed. There is some reading material even. And the air conditioning works. But you know what? I'll be the sad fuck to complain about this train actually.</p>

    <p>First of all, there is little legroom. I felt as if I was travelling in an economy, even low-cost flight carrier. It's also not that easy to use your laptop, as the sliding table provided is just not large enough. There are also no power plugs which, personally, it seems a huge oversight. I know that some trains in Europe and many all in all do not provide you the option to charge your electronic devices. But you would expect such a service in a high speed train, especially considering what the customers are being charged for the travel. Also, I know trains are supposed to take you from point A to B. But I have travelled with a variety of configurations and frankly, the interior design could have been done better. This is actually a criticism that I have to public transport in this country as a whole. Sure, you have T-Money card with which you can pay literally anywhere in Korea for a variety of services, also public transport. But if you need to pay for a ticket without the card, the system is that you throw your banknote into a box and you receive your change manually by the driver. The fleet is substandard and although it could be argued that it is reasonably cheap, you'll get a hellovabetter service in... Australia even. But I'm comparing this to other countries too, such as Germany - where it's better. Can't compete with the modern fleet that you can come across in Poland, though, where wifi is onboard, disabled-accessible fleet, LCD screens, ample room and comfy seats are available for less than what Korea charges for. That at least partially extends to train fleet, which is just more comfortable in many other countries. Which prompts me to ask as to why should other countries not try going ahead with high-speed solutions? Seems like it's just the infrastructure, which will require immense amounts of resources invested. But they do conduct these investments all the time now too.</p>

    <center><h4>True Welcoming Party</h4></center>
    
    <p>Well, let's see. I came off the train. Beforehand I didn't. I had a glimpse of the city and some actually pretty nice shots of clusters of the CBD. But then afterwards I did get off the train, with the station looking quite massive, inviting with a McDonald's, alike Lotteria and a French-like bakery. Now I could continue with me describing how I purchased an overpriced fresh juice mix from the French-like bakery with a selection of pastries and a coffee made of severely overroasted coffee beans, how I walked outside towards the west contrary to where I headed, how much I was disappointed with the view of multiple concrete blocks obscurring the potentially overwhelming view of Seoul, how I got lost in the subway and had trouble topping up my card but eventually finding my way and making my way towards a station, from which I picked up my simcard but finding the hidden away office neither easy nor not time-consuming and me finding the proper place could be considered as one of those miracles that at times take place throughout my travels. Then crashing at a starbucks with a kenyan cold coffee, named normally in the west as Frappe but served as a standard in Korea ever since summers here do get crazy hot and humid. Then taking off to sightsee the city, starting from this starbucks harboured in an area I would bit later than sooner redisover in proper frashion, how entire districts can go through and complete an utter metamorphosis. I pierced through this city a few times and in the end I considered it to amount to 50:50, neither good nor bad, which is still not quite a bad result as this particular first encounter was the one that I summed up in a rather negative stance. But then, describing all the details of my trip would be quite lengthy though and I do like to introduce a bit of variety to my texts, for the sake of myself and in some twisted way the readers coming from the outside world.</p>

    <p>My total number of trips to or via Seoul amounted to around... 4 or 5. This first one was probably one of the lengthiest and I had there were some other things I had to deal with at some other times. One of the tricks I learned and was happy to take advantage of was utilising the cheaper flexible 4 day KTX ticket, which at the discounted rate for students as I believe cost at the time 123 000 KRW. That's currently an equivalent of 152 AU$, my currency was likely a bit stronger at that time of the year, though. Now it is 193 000 KRW. The use of the ticket is much more restricted now and at the time I still had to deal with some restrictions, such as I had to use the ticket within 10 days and use only the normal KTX, not the second generation version of the high speed trains. Considering South Korea is a relatively small country, I figured I could do certain one-day trips, for instance: go to Seoul and back, which I have done in this particular instance. There were other, crazier destinations: when I went to Busan and then back to Seoul just so that I could catch my flight to Jeju Island from which I had my next flight nearby Daejeon. I would still have explored and squeezed attractions in those timeslots, though. I would have gone to Seoraksan National Park via Seoul and Gangneung on which route I would discover a slightly different type of a KTX with power sockets and which would take a longer time to travel but have just as majestic views outside your window. From which I would have a connecting route to Sokcho and then the National Park itself, from which I would return to Seoul and then Daejeon. The train trip itself to Gangneung would have cost me normally 51 000 KRW, therefore I truly thought I was getting the bang for the buck. One of my final encounters was a quick one day trip to Seoul again, I'm not sure if that one was by KTX but I managed to see quite plenty and truly appreciate the city on that time overall, seeing one of the better parts of what Seoul had to offer.</p>

    <p>
      This is a massive city. Its metropolitan area entails 25.6 million people. This is practically half of South Korea's population, imagine half a country's population squeezed around a capital area. I don't know a second country with this kind of stats and especially I don't know a second country with such stats despite being located rather close to North Korean border, I guess a part of the same nation and country with which it is still technically in war with. In a way this sounds crazy but if you took a look at how the war itself progressed when it broke out, crazy becomes a very interesting term, shifting perhaps towards a term I'd call as daring. Still, if anything did happen and things took a turn for the worse, I'd assume there would be one humanitarian crisis of a totally unprecedented scale. But perhaps there wouldn't, there was much in Korea that did surprise me after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      In any case, visting all the interesting places becomes impossible in a short timespan. Moving around by public transport around this city takes time, quite substantial too which can blow out to over an hour of commute each way within the city itself. Covering wide grounds is also very challenging, on my first trip I pierced from the Central Station through and up to the palace complex, while it theory that is merely just 2.7 km, once you try to see as many things on the way, over the day my samsung health would show a whoopin' 35 km treaded by foot. And I would have still not been able to see even half of the destinations I was scheduled to see, most of which I would manage to check off my list with the very next trips. But I'll get to all those shortly and obviously also what I should have but not managed to check.

    <center><h4>Homeplus Homeless</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      One of the first striking contrasts I have noted in my first hours in Seoul was the number of homeless people, taking refuge by Seoul's train station. Playing cards, drinking, driving conversations. And compared to that, a tall pedestrian overpass, during the day showing off its ambundance of gorgeous vegetation on a plain concrete construction overseen by a few, probably shooing off the homeless (although that's just pure speculation now) and minding the tidiness of the overpass. During the night, which I would discover on one of my later stops here, all illuminated in blue, giving an idea of as if futuristic construct which I did actually like, the idea and execution, having a bit of view over the city and the convenience of moving without much of a hassle from the station, deeper into the likely more touristy districts intown. But just the idea of seeing all the less wealthy harboured below, just kind of felt wrong in a way, as if many of the passers-by would be looking down, not necessarily, but the contrasts were clear, especially how many where below and how little-to-none were actually passing over the supposedly futuristic construct. I don't remember whether I broached this topic with some of the local students at KAIST, perhaps I did and I forgot about why was that the case. I'd assume many of those were at war but perhaps many are just people who were looking for a better future in the capital city and found themselves on the street instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      This city itself would not rather shine off with contrasts, though. I'd rather say diversity and it would remain strong with what each district would be able to offer. I mainly seek more interesting places, cultural sites and majestic views. Seoul can offer substantially more and it offers a bit of an interesting mix, before I could explain Korea as sort of a bridge between China and Japan with all its good and bad crossovered in multiple ways. Basically the clash and fluidity of the old and the new could be seen plainly without batting an eye. On my first encounter, I would check by an LGBT festival by Town Hall after I detoured from a very oldfashioned market and even before, a well eco-futuristic overpass from a rather modernistic train station. I checked by the festival a bit by an accident as there was a cultural complex right next to it reaching the older times of Korea and I was also underway to reaching yet another cultural complex reaching likely the times of the founder of Korea but to reach it I would have to lead along a very extensive as-if totalitarian/social-realism style (made for military parades) alley, congested now to hell by the people attending the festival and a massive counter-demonstration lead from it would seem as Christians trying to crossover and deafen the music played at the festival and a very high concentration of police making huge efforts to contain all this, securing key areas such as hotels nearby, entrances and such. Weirdly enough, I do not remember seeing the military here, soldiers are a very frequent sight in this country but paradoxically this kind of does strengthen the feeling of security here. In the end, Korea was comparably safe to Japan overall, or at least according to statistics these are very alike. You can see clearly that is a massive mix of everything here, kind of all sorted out but my problem laid elsewhere, just none of what I came across really offered anything particularly great. The first trip I marked was for most of it, just rather... average.

      So what was so average overall? Glad you asked! Well, perhaps I've already mentioned the station and the simcard parts, also the festival at Town Hall but perhaps I'll elaborate a bit on this. I made a stop here either before or after visiting the cultural sight nearby. The good thing is, many of the places around here do offer student discounts, at least for KAIST students and in many cases, entry was even for free, I think to this one it was after all (either that or 500 KRW, so cheapskatemate). This place was kinda cool, nicely populated garden, a bit of an oasis within a very urban world. Even the museum within the oasis (I think that was for free for me after all) had pretty good contemporary pieces inside but just not so many. In the end, there was not much that this joint offered and that seemed to have remained quite the case for the remainder of this trip. I had to take a break nearby, I'm not sure whether it was Seoul or some other stuff I was doing in the previous days, I didn't care what sort of festival it was (although I'm not big on LGBT movement, seeing how it does look like so far away as in Korea did seem interesting), I heard some metal music I have known so I figured, dropping by, seeing what's there and taking perhaps a quick break/nap on the grass near the scene is not a bad idea. Once I regenerated, I made my way to the main palace complex, where I have seen the ceremonial guard changing thing, gathering a crowd but not being anything really making it standing from the crowd of similar guard changing ceremonies around the world. And then I dropped in and... I realised that this looks very alike to the Forbidden Palace that I have seen in Beijing. I swear, if I have not seen it, I would have much more liked my next 2 hours spent here. And that's what I kept telling my friends, that it was not bad, although crazy hot with not much shade to be offered and completely dehydrating me over the course of discovering every single angle of that complex but it just didn't feel ultimately, as in, just, Korean. And that was a letdown, especially that I didin't understand why.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was recommended to see contemporary art museum nearby an said not to see some other museum nearby. I took the advise, the entry was free on that day and what I was greeted upon was an array of new art and not that much of it either. Again, a bit of a letdown, as for such a huge complex, there was not that much that it ultimately offered. I have been to some other museum founded by the Lee family of Samsung. Getting to this one was a bit of a hassle and finding it was utterly not easy at all. Hidden among many residential buildings, along a beautiful road overlooking the southern bank of Seoul on one side and the other, a massive park with the Seoul Tower that I have not climbed, as I'm often not big on such attractions (prefer just climbing regular vantage points). Once I reached the museum, that one did make quite a bit of an impression, with its architecture, design, the pieces, presentation of artworks and the selection of paintings which entailed a pretty good range of widely regarded contemporary art artists. Also the price was quite impressive too, 5000 KRW but I liked the pieces presented there and I had the opportunity of catching up with a person I've known. However, there were just not enough pieces to justify the pricing itself. I also tried reaching an area called Gangnam but I managed only to reach some place called Gangnam-Gu, where there was literally just nothing. And the hassle took more than 2 hours almost jeopardising my return to KAIST. Which it did in a way, as I had to take one of the later trains back but there were no buses going to the uni itself, at which point my decision was, instead of any sane person to take a taxi, to take the entire ~8-9 kilometers back by foot. I didn't manage to eat anything really Korean at that time, just taco bell and a coffee at starbucks. I didn't see anything that would particularly make Seoul feel that it was so amazing. The view on the southern bank was actually really good, giving an idea of exactly how widespread this city is but the park nearby would be so dense with vegetation with no clearer view over the city which was again - a letdown. Perhaps they've dunnit on purpose to keep the noise from the nearby street at low but I've seen in Korea this to be rather a usual thing, weirdly, just not clearing selective trees which would give an amazing view. Busan was an exception, very pleasant one in the end. But I'm not in a position to judge whether that's good or bad ultimately. I can only show what I feel about such thing being a thing.

      I have mentioned another thing, of me doing this speedy trip from Busan to Jeju over Seoul. How I managed to still see something in Seoul was as following: I didn't have to go to the international airport, just the other one still ongoing closer to the center. So I just reached the station, took a nightbus to the famous Dongdaemun Design Plaza. I already mentioned something in the Busan post but I'll just chip in again: neo-futuristic but if that's what we're getting in the future, I'd rather pack myself on the rocket and get myself outta this planet. Apparently it lights up nicely in the evening but at 2 AM, it was just all shut down so instead, I just managed to experience a bland, empty brick, a gray even, in which from what I recall a design museum is placed but a few pianos were being played which kind of brightened up the area. It seems that the complex was built somehow in coherence adjacently to some of sort of ruins, at least archeological pieces, which didn't really change much of my opinion about this complex, which felt as if created in 15 minutes in a 3D Modelling app. Perhaps this is the future but not the one I'm looking forward to and in fact, Seoul on my 3rd of 4th, I think 4th trip managed to showcase something much more inspiring in this regards which elevated my opinion on this city (go figure, sometimes one thing can change your mind). Unfortunately I managed to miss my bus and have large trouble with getting my T-Money card recharged with a lack of ATM and funds on my citibank account. I managed to get a later bus and hardly scramble the higher amount needed for the night bus which took almost 1.5h to get to the airport (if not more), although not directly. I had to cover some distance by foot as well but I managed to catch my flight not that long after. Also, one of the beauty about the carriers in Korea, they're cheap. And some despite being cheap, give also the opportunity to pack some luggage such as AirBusan of which I took advantage in regards to planning my route back to Japan (it was not really settled). But if any of you consider going to Korea, consider flying around and making sure you reserve a window seat because the view from up there is just breathtaking. Either way you choose, plane or train, at times even bus, you won't regret it. My third trip was to Seoraksan National Park and my stop really entailed a 15 minute walk out of the station and packing myself back into another train. Then on my way back, it was fairly similar. Although not quite. I just got back by bus as I spent too much time at Seoraksan (I'll write some other day on that or later even, it's worth even as a bonus). Then had to change for a metroline where a couple of drunk Koreans explained how I should get to the station and one guided me to the connecting metroline and were very helpful (although I think were talking shit and mentioning KAIST but that's fine). Took the train back and that's how much I've seen on my third encounter. Plus again, I think I had to walk back because of how late I came back to Daejeon. Freakin' buses stop working well after 10:30-11 PM... (That's a crime against humaniy, or students!).

    <p>
      Everyone have been telling me: Nah man, you gotta give Seoul another chance. Nah man, Seoul is my favorite city in Asia. Nah Seoul is such an amazing city. Everyone spoke so highly of Seoul that at some point I was like Okay! Okay. I'll do it one more time and this time was by bus cause my Korail ticket was done for already. Pretty much of the last days I've been still here and as it turned out I was one of the last people at KAIST from all the international students. Kinda depressing seeing all these empty hallways, I mean there were still a few in the area and I would meet them but hell, this time it just felt weird and seeing that I still had a bit of time left, well, gotta do this Seoul one more time + I had a few errands to run. I swear there might have been one more time I've actually gone there for a bit but hell I don't remember... Either way, I knew that this city is really massive and saying it sucks just based on my not even few days visitting is just simply not fair, I just knew that. And there were a few places I just had to still do and eventually I was very happy that I managed to get them, well almost all checked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me just throw a few statistics: According to my phone I have walked for good 40 kilometers on that day (in part because I fucked up with my bus connection and ended up at an entirely different bus station closer to the train station and got lost in the process and had to spend the night at a different university) and in the process I have burned 2041 kcal. I have visited Lotte World Tower and the nearby complex, I have been to the actual Gangnam area, seen War Memorial of Korea and National Museum of Korea, both of which I have sort of speedran through, I managed to see a cultural area right next to the palace complex, visit Insadong area, Cheonggyecheon and Hongik University area. Let me just say that is a fuckload in a day, I've reached the city early in the morning and expressely blazed through most of the sights and... hehe, almost lost my last connecting bus to Daejeon. I've been pushing to the limit here y'all and also like I mentioned, I had to spend the night at the different University campus, which I have done at the top of its tallest building. I have no idea how I managed to do this but hey, there was not a living soul in it, I had access to it and could even refresh myself in the toilet and work a bit on my computer on some random stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the good thing was that most of these sights were actually very good and I managed to do even a bit more in the end by dwindling Korean cuisine into the mix. I'm going to try to recreate my steps here by gazing at my google locations, keeping an eye on all my movements like a good George Orwell would have projected back in the industrial days.

    <center><h4>Whatawhat</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      I have started with the southern bank and Lotte World just because I have reached a quite faraway bus complex. It was just a metroride with a bit of a sight over the eastern part of the city. Many have been telling tales of what Lotte World is, from what I have seen, my personal perspective - what happens when the corporate world becomes too powerful and in a bit, wrong. These guys have shares in likely every single market out there. They have their own McDonalds called Lotteria, they have juices, sweets even considered as classics in this country. Hotels and car rentals. And what's even more interesting is that every one and each of those seem to have the name of their mothe company - Lotte, a conglomerate that seems to be Korean but apparently is jointly managed with a Japanese part. Here, they decided to built not just one, but a complex of skyscrapers that were on each side of the crossroads' intersection. Lotte World Tower was naturally the highest and most shining, my instagram photo has striken quite a bit of likes there and on facebook, where some noted of my arrival to the city and I agreed to meet a friend at Hongik University later this day. The tower itself has malls layered in it, spanning across many many floors with the corporate taking the higher levels, naturally. The other Lotte next door had also many levels, many many of them dedicated to just selling products, many of which domestic but also many many international. The other two complexes I could not get, except that one was golden and the other just hidden away. I'm not sure how to call all this. There was some green in the area. Obviously I reached it by metro. Is it a display of corporate greed? Power? I don't know, I have heard and read of stuff that certain western companies do own competing with one another brands and hence manage to keep on growing as there is no real choice on the market. If that is the case, that's smart. Because Lotte just wants to brand everything they own with their own name but is that smart? Especially that many of their products are just simply borderline quality?
    </p>

        <p>
      Next up, along the way was Gangnam, to which I commuted by a bus so I could get a grasp on the this part of town's architecture. The view wasn't obviously perfect. Would have benefitted if I just rented a bike as apparently it's quite easy and cheap for tourists to do so in Seoul. But bus it was and I was taken to Gangnam which... at first didn't quite kill me with its beauty but was quite impressive with very modern-looking highrises and very lively side streets sprawling with locals and toursits alike. Just as any other city it would be full of enterprises to visit and dine at. I kind of gambled and decided to eat somewhere close where tripadvisor recommended me and I passed, obviously, a gangnam style sign for tourists along the way. Funny thing about many of the places around Korea, how modern looking they would be, the side streets will be driven with a local flavour, a bit overly squeezed - some, I guess that's just how they do in Korea and it's not necessarily bad, it's got a bit of a fusion taste to it. I think I ordered something spicy, now I gotta look into my photo history, hold on... Oh, it wasn't, it was the kimchi that was spicy. Wherever you went and ordered something, you'd get kimchi. Awesome stuff. And rice. I ordered some sort of dumplings, I think with chives and some meat and noodles. Good stuff and closed my budget in about 10 000 KRW so I was content and pushed another instagram post along the way. From here I had to take another bus but I also ventured a little bit and managed to pick up on, my eyes at least, some really, amazing, ecstatic modern architecture. One - being wavy. I mean what I'm saying, the frickin' structure was wavy, wobbly, you name it. The other, had a blend of greenery in it as well. Overall, I was content with at least the architecture I saw here, now I could say with absolute honesty that yes, Seoul does have amazing architecture at least in Gangnam, which seems very modern and apparently, this is ultimately some of the rich people's area. In case war broke out, southern bank would be ultimately safer. And apparently they have clubs, where it is almost impossible to get in. I'm not a clubbing person, though. Apparently this area becomes totally different after hours too. I wish to see that one day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next stop were the museums. Hey, these could close early likely and it was surprisingly getting late already. Go figure, I just merely arrived and already gotta speedrun through next places. I decided to do both despite the lack of time. War memorial of Korea seemed like a must and the outer space was actually really powerful. The sculptures were extremely well made and depicted emotions to a great extent, making people dwell for a moment. Not that far there was a statue of two soldiers holding each other. Even without knowing the background, you could easily tell somehow the background and I guessed it, two brothers fighting for different sides in the same war between the same nation. Like I said, the outer area outside the memorial, it was just simply powerful. There were flags showcasing other nations involved on the southern side and some good quotes: 'If you want peace remember war', 'freedom is not free'. Could sound cheap but considering the environment and circumstances, the ambiguity is quite striking with the outside area being quite widespread and monumental. I think it does take quite a substantial effort to get such area up and make it THAT presentable. The inside of the memorial however gave me a mixed impression. It was a cluster of rooms that kept about different wars in Korea, not necessarily just the recent one. Which is not bad itself but just I didn't seem to see any coherent story there, a line which would connect all this. Plus upon entrying to the right, there were models of military vehicles with a view downstairs on a massive children playground... I'm not sure whether this is a good place for this. I understand the necessity to educate children but this just takes away the piety and solemnity of the memorial. Other than that, there is not much to be said about the memorial.
    </p>

    <p>
      From there I made quickly my way to the National Museum on the other side. I might have even had to take a bus to get there. In the end, it turned out the museum was closing later that day so I was like, yaaay! And hell yay, cause from what I recall, the entry was free to each at least for me and the National Museum area was actually very nice. To get to the entrance you'd have to walk past a very well maintained park with a pond right next to it, the entire complex felt very modern and clearly it had quite some money poured into it. In the end, I discovered that the Lee family did donate. The museums scattered across a few levels and showcased an array of objects: of archeological nature, applied art but also paintings. But now, what this museum had were two things that made me particularly happy. On one hand, it was one of these museums that I particularly was not big on but what made me look at it in a positive sense was the presentation, just like the British Museum, the interior design, sorting, curation and just simply presentation of the artworks in conjunction with the lightning, absolutely mesmerising making even just simply trivial things shine out really well and just being interesting. The other thing just made it not so trivial all in all but I can only give an example of the paintings, which were not quite just paintings. They were but a bit Japanese style but still not quite, this was one form that I could truly say, that yes, this is Korean, the arrangement of colours and subjects etc. That's what I was looking for and I got exactly what I came for. There was one more wing for which I would have had to pay but the main thing already siphoned most of my time allowed to stay here, I managed to blaze through everything and leave the museum content in the end. From here? I made my way to Insa-Dong, apparently a market area.

      Here I had a few things to do. First, just walk. And hell, again, the architecture here, absolutely stunning. These highrises here are absolutely the thing but I won't say anything until I get my photos post-processed (which may be never). Insa-Dong itself... well, it's a marketspace for tourists really. I bought 3 pokemon cans for the price of 1, at certain convenience stores they do that, which one of my friends would say tasted like medicine. And I was on the lookout for one special thing. Until I got this one thing, I would however drop by a... green tea shop/cafe, where I would get green tea Patbingsu shaved ice portion (which had actual green tea ice cream inside) and red beans on it, some green tea I just picked and which was delivered with a timer (how professional! They would do something similar with coffee at Seoraksan) and I think it was a piece of green tea tiramisu? All were fantastic, amounted to be a bit pricey but still worth the green to get all this green and yet another instagram pushed up after the earlier one at the museum. From here, I visited a nearby shopping artsy center, which had an amazing rooftop, bought... oh shit wait, in this case I must have actually arrived in Seoul one more time! As I swear I reached Insa-Dong on another time, when everything got closed here along with the center but I managed to see older part of the city close to the palace complex but at night! Or perhaps it was this time? Am I tripping? Let's merge those two then, I have seen this older part of the city which... well, they were not well lit so I was pushing it with my DSLR setup, which managed to handle those pretty well, focusing and so. The view over the city was pretty solid. It seemed the area was populated with residents which was interesting to see, considering how utterly Korean this area felt. After all, I think this was also UNESCO Heritage. Complex carvings and rooftops and all, as if you just teleported yourself to a completely different space and time with only the highrises in the background scathing your experience. Which actually was a very interesting addition during my trip to the palace complex by the way. On one end you would see a massive mountain growing and on the other, a define contrast between the walls of the complex itself and the highrises popping up out of the blue. The mountain however, I should have done it on some day, apparently the view from over there, even despite it's not easy to hike through, is just simply worth the effort. But also, again, what if war broke out? This is a really deadly vantage.

      I had to get some sort of scrolls for my mom as she wanted those. She also wanted so paint brushes but could not eventually settle on what she really needed. These took a bit of a hit on my budget and also, despite me almost not reaching the bus on time, I also had some issues with finances at this point, really counting on me closing the budget, which I did but barely (citibank account got depleted once again heh). I walked through Insa-Dong and reached one veeeeery interesting place. I swear I am feeling as if it is a Deja-Vu, I must have been writing about this somewhere else. But basically after catching a bus from this... okay I did not walk back from Insa-Dong, I caught a bus to the river from the UNESCO area with a view. The river itself, is not just simply a river. It's a worldwide marvel, something that I consider as one of the most if not most beautiful thing I have seen in my entire life. It's not just measured by beauty itself, it's certainly not exactly natural. It's just how beautiful it is by not just how it looks like, which is absolutely stunning after hours but by its history of what it was, the struggle and opposition there was to getting it built, yes, this river historically was here and was transformed into a highway. At some point there was someone who came up with this utterly insane idea, because who in the right mind would think of chopping up a highway and putting a river there instead? This sounds like from a complete different galaxy, a romantic tale that only takes place in dramas, fantasy books and so on. Something impossible to get underway, absolute science fiction and the perfect ride for a political career ending way, with the potential to end up branded as some other sort of crazy. And yet... it became real. Somehow, someone, managed, decided and pulled through an incredibly expensive endeavour to turn kilometers of highway into a very drawn down, peaceful, quiet and amazingly soothing line. I wouldn't necessarily call it a river, more of a creek that you can pass by hopping past on rocks. Lots of bushes and trees managed, thriving and organised in a varied way. Lightning is embedded subtly and the area ends with a lit waterfall. All the way along which you can see many, many primarily Koreans, spending time with one another. Socialising, having drinks, flirting, hanging out, doing stuff, jogging etc. Some food trucks are in the area, some buskers playing musing above. It's as if someone decided to pierce Seoul with nature, the combination of the story, of the execution, of how people are responding to it. Now that, I can consider a wet dream of eco-futurists coming true in all its glory, in such that nobody can contest. One very expensive demonstration of all this but so beautiful and majestic, that it remains one of this world's wonders that's really close to my heart. I wish to see more of such projects, especially that it did become successful and a lot of wildlife decided to move in there. Just the harmony in such massive metropoly, you could think as if you just entered a fairyland, except this was no fairy, people made this happen, the ultimate beauty of it.

      I was hoping to eat something soon but a place on my way was closed. I did get some fresh watermelon juice with ice on my way packed quite funilly. Then I reconnected with my friend and reached Hongik University, which I rediscovered just now as an extremely vibrant precinct. I did not quite expect this. Sure there were some clubs a bit further down but what this place was truly famous for were the students who'd be performing one to another, either dancing or playing instruments. After all the Hongik University consists of art students and they would perform after hours right here, get some money and attract a lot of attention. The crowds! Truly, there were lots and lots and lots of people gathering to see all the performances. My friend kind of introduced me to the area, he was spending a day or a few in Seoul after the studies have ended. I just enjoyed the vibe here and the liveliness, there were a lot of tourists here as well. And I also liked how the area had the trees being lit by nearby stores and how it all functioned in a lively harmony. Afterwards we ate at someplace nearby, the Bibimbap was only fair but that was entirely okay, I didn't have much money left anyway and started getting worried as to how I was about to return home as my transform to the bank would be coming late. It was a serious problem, which blew out of propotion a bit - on one hand, I had to get a ticket back home and in one of the preceding days, I already had the money borrowed from a friend due to me becoming quite hit after the last night of drinks. In the end, I could not pay for the taxi, so I had returned the money to him and I could not really borrow anymore and I did not want to do that either. Also, the time was getting a bit late and I had to take of the last connecting buses. I didn't know how expensive these would be but I managed to get myself packed in one of the departing ones and this one took me somewhere I should not have not reached really and spending the night elsewhere. Either way, the buses here in Korea have a bit of a strange system overall. Departing to different terminals, having different price ranges and not easy to communicate in English in a good manner. But eventually when you show what you want with naver they'll oblige, except some errors could be made.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, this was my last encounter with Seoul, which turned out to be a very positive one. I did not manage to visit a design-clothes market, I did not manage to visit a few libraries I was recommended and one particular cafe I could not find. I could not reach some districts, one of which far away but ultramodern Korea that I had in mind before reaching Korea, turning out to be different... but not disappointing really. Seoul was a bit different in this regards, I always say that the capital city can function as a sort of a postcard of a country, business card so to say. After all, here especially, half the country's population living in and near the capital city. I actually preferred most of the other cities I have visited in Korea. But as in any of the massives, there always are great places to discover, some of which blew my mind away like the river-became-highway-became-river marvel. It was a bit of a mix, less or better kept. Not too mind-boggling, quite nicely arranged and had some upper hand in some ways here too. Perhaps I should give another chance for street food that I kept a bit away from but of which I did not see too much either. Would I recommend it? I would recommend Korea and Seoul is a proper entrypoint to this country. Even if I flew in to Daegu, there are things you can primarily get done in Seoul first like the simcard, which is a huge and expensive hassle to get elsewhere. Many historical and cultural points will be here as well. And then, you can decide whether to go east, south... I certainly did perceive Korea in a very pleasant manner, very much of a convergence between the east and west in this part of Asia with primarily all the best of each that can be found here. The pearls are a bit hidden around... But there's something to accommodate everyone and then some.

    <center><h4>Convenience</h4></center>
    Now, if you're hungry, you may visit some of the convenience stores nearby. Or go to cafeterias. Or go to bars. This campus has quite a fair share of amenities. There are cafes where you can buy... well, coffee or tea. There are 'restaurants', where you can by Korean food. A fair share is placed in a cafeteria that is right outside the dormitory. And it also has, well, a canteen that serves a variety of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'll get back to this one soon. There are burger places and apparently bars where they offer beer, yep on campus. And weirdly enough many shops are closed on... Saturday.<br><br>

    There is a hairdresses. There is a general appliance store. Literally most of what you may need is on site so you just need to make the effort to drop by here and there.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Food</h4></center>
    Now, food. That is one of the positives in terms of KAIST, although I was receiving some reserved opinions in regards to it. After my exceedingly pleasant experience in Japan, although with some exceptions, I looked forward towards what I would be served here in Korea. A bit spoiled by ideas of healthy food and some experience I already had from eating overseas, well... canteen's offer did actually come across as quite pleasantly surprising. Not all of the food seems great but all reach a certain level of decency and some actually taste quite great! What interests me more, though, is its health benefits. And now, I gotta say that my first days were spent crazily. On one hand, the cafeteria offers a range of foods served for breakfast (8:00-9:30), lunch (11:30-13:30) and dinner (17:30-19:30). The undergraduate cafeteria at least operates in these hours so its fits quite well with the summer school's schedule (9:00-12:00, 14:00-17:00). The options are varied and entail fixed dishes (~4000-5000 KRW) or a selection of sides that are differentiated in terms of their size. My first days spent here were crazy, as I just packed literally everything that there was and now I'm... wondering, whether despite imposing an extreme physical strain throughout my travels, I didn't by any chance gain on any weight that I so eagerly tried losing?<br><br>

    In any case, the food selection is quite interesting. Primarily id's say it consists of meat, especially pork and chicken. Fish are served quite frequently, although frankly I have literally no idea how to eat this with a pair of sticks. At this point, eating rice with sticks is easier than fish with bones. So, chicken teriyaki, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken chicken, chicken with soy sauce, breadcrumbs coated chicken... chicken chicken chicken, they have no shame but be game, I actually praise this system where proteins take over the reins. Especially that I haven't been eating enough of this and I gotta convalescence after last semester. Then there are the veggies, which usually entail bean sprouts and... kimchi. Always kimchi. Kimchi kimchi kimchi. Even when there's always chicken, there can't be enough of kimchi, although I'm a bit underwhelmed by its quality (serious). There are also other salads available and potatoes, especially breadcrumbs coated (?) and fried are something that can be seen around. The deserts usually consist of a fruit salad or... actually, I haven't seen many deserts around, probably for the best then? However, if you need a drink, you can get a flavored milk... wait, they drink milk in this country? :O<br><br>

    I thought in Asian countries, as actually in most of the world, people are rather lactose intolerant. But, well, there there is, strawberry flavored milk, chocolate flavored milk, milk with coffee etc. And that costs as much as chicken. I think I forgot to mention some of the prices, so: usually a set of sides that I acquire without the drinks amounts to around ~4000-5000 KRW. The set dishes can go up to ~4000-5000 KRW as well but as I'm a person who loves the concept of a "swedish table" and basically having the freedom to choose the foods you're interested in, so I usually pack the sides in. Sometimes there will be a bowl or rice or a bowl of fried rice with some additional stuff (I would love to be more precise, the photos ought to give an idea of what's included). Kimchi always goes for 300 KRW. Chicken sides come at ~600-900 KRW with larger ones topping at between ~1000-1700 KRW, depends on what it actually entail, either just chicken or a mix with salad. Fish come around between ~1200-1700 KRW. How much does the KRW actually amount? Well... 5000 KRW is around 6 AU$. So it's decent and cheap. Significantly cheaper compared to what's offered in Sydney. Very comparable to what you get in Munich (~4-5 Euro dishes). The flexibility comes somewhere at the middle. And I'm still yet to explore other options, ie. fixed dishes offered outside on the campus. I'm still also going to say the food served is of very decent quality and you can pay by cash or card, with me preferring the cash option.<br><br>

    I haven't really explored other options, so you'll need to be paitient for that blog. But all in all the social life is a bit disappointing so we'll see how it will evolve, if it will altogether. I'm still yet to explore the city more thoroughly and I will likely have to wait until the field trip takes place and the weather settles down, as apparently I went in during the Monsoon season. So yeah, I'm screwed. There's a national park west from here and some sort of a river area east. There are plenty of cities to visit around but I'll likely have to wait until I finish one of my units and survive the mid-term exams. So one more thing that I could mention is the supermarkets. This country has costco. And E-Market which is like costco. What costco is, is something that even I did not quite was aware of. A warehouse where you can buy bulk items. I bought 0.55 kg of blueberries for 10000 KRW and 0.9 kg of cherries for 12000 KRW. Well what? Berries are expensive in Australia and I was craving those badly... On the other hand there is the Homeplus. And that is an interesting topic to showcase.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Shop 'till you Drop</h4></center>
    Okay mate. Homeplus. I was told there are two supermarkets down from KAIST campus and that it takes quite a while to get there so I should take... a taxi to reach it. That's right folks, people at KAIST use taxis to go places! And I'm not joking, you can even use your T-money card to pay for the journey, which apparently is quite cheap, especially if you travel in groups. In fact, I was told that Uber is more expensive than taxis (!!!). So if you travel in groups, the fee comes down to around 1000 KRW, ain't hefty at all so the convenience probably in combination beats all the other options. There are many cycle paths, which are especially well developed along the riversides. But all the pedestrians... don't give a few flying green teas about this, so they just wander through those and, in theory, I don't blame them, as it seems that cyclists were prioritised here. Still, in general I am seeing that propriety, at least in the city, is quite quite mixed. And again, I will have to foreset a distinction between Korea and Japan, with the latter turning out as, well, turbo pleasant. I will showase Japan in one of the later blogs as it is really one topic that just shifted how I imagined this country and which exceeded in expectations in a myriad of ways, making it one of the countries that I could potentially be looking forward to even living in. But yeah, here in Korea, in theory everything is very well organised. But in practice, it... just works.<br><br>

    Not quite as intended that is. The cars won't stop till you pass the street. People won't hold the door for you if you follow them. People won't line up to access a train. Pedestrians use cycle paths. I mean, all these are just small things and being pleasant to others is somewhat encoded actually into this culture from what I know but, well... Okay, Homeplus! So that's an interesting venue. See, when I say a supermarket I mean a place like, Woolworths or Coles in Australia, which are probably one of the largest supermarkets you'll likely come across. In Germany, some equivalents could be counted as Tangelmann, maybe Edeka and partially even Lidl nowadays. In Poland, we have probably shops like Biedronka, also Lidl, Tesco... there are many more but these are the supermarket-sized places, in general, okay? Now, in Korea the supermarket I went to, called Homeplus was... a hypermarket, which reminded me of such that I came across in... Poland, exclusively. Now, in order to imagine this more vividly, take a regular supermarket and blow it out of propotion by twice or three times in size. Chuck in everything that you may ever need to buy with some selection and... voila, this is were you can buy bread, sweets and meat but also a microwave, bicycle and a smartphone if you really feel like it's a good idea. Now the one in Korea is... huge and it actually primarily features... hardware. Like 2/3 of the store is hardware and 1/3 is actual food. In Poland, I'd argue it's usually 50/50 or 2/3 food, 1/3 hardware. In Poland, you have Auchan, Carrefour, even Kaufland to some extent and there may be more that are somewhere at the back of my head. I'm still surprised that these shops in Poland still withstand the fierce competition and it literally did get extremely crowded in recent years. But that's for another blog. Here on the other hand, Homeplus does get crowded too and it seems that it's binded with Tesco. There are many small stalls were they give out tasters. And in case of hardware stalls, there are many advisors recommending their products. It feels more like a hypermarket entailing a variety of traders, who advertise their merchandise - which gives an idea of a simple market.<br><br>

    The prices are relatively low, although it is very hard to get a grasp on how much you are actually spending in this country. Literally, adjusting to a new system always takes time and it's just eventually that gets to your head what you're actually eating, how much you are eating and subsequently how much you're spending. Still, many drinks go for 1000 KRW, larger ones for 2000 KRW. In such case I see a distinction between convenience stores and this particular hypermarket, which is not that severe as prices in convenience stores are maybe ~50% higher. It is a distinction but not so severe to make frequent trips to the store placed far away. There are many stalls where they sell food that they make on site, which is nice. What pains me though, is that there is not such a huge variety of foods available in terms of, idk, local sweets for instance. There are many imported products and such that are just sold by giants. I saw European beers, chocolate, biscuits and sweets. Same went for cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, that's actually cool but I was counting on more distinct stuff. And in this terms, the sweets were quite underwhelming and surprisingly low-quality. Perhaps I don't what what to eat then? There was not a large selection of fruits either, which were quite expensive too. What pained me for a bit the most, though, was that certain products were, as if, missing. I could not find any body wash, which is a standard for me, I just don't like using soap bars. In Australia or Europe, there is a large selection of those, in Korea, I hardly could find one. Body lotions on the other hand? Tons available.<br><br>

    There is a large selection of teas and juices/water based on infusions from teas, cocoa and other stuff that I don't quite get the taste. Some of it I began to stop drinking, as was purely sugar. And in case of sweets, I got stuffed with those in Japan and Korea and I think I'll stop as the quality is too varied and these are empty calories after all. Most of it is quite distinct, though. I will provide some more information once I actually try a bit of this and that. Ice cream is relatively expensive and underwhelming surprisingly. Also, convenience stores are usually packed, especially 7/11 which are a God send, since their ATMs do not incur fees on my end (citibank life!).<br><br>

    Still, the way how they compress these venues... amazing but does everything really sell?<br><br>
