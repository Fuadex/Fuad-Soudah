    I'm in a train. Somewhere, in the middle of nowhere. Roaming from point A to B. Although, still yet unsure as to which was A and whether there is a B. At the moment, the B is a home, that I have currently in Sydney. Technically, still considered Sydney but quite is it? In the last month, I managed to see quite a bit and unfortunately in the process, spend quite a bit. But it is fairly okay, 'it's all allocated for education', I keep telling myself. Which would be right and people keep telling me, if not now then when? That's a perspective I should have acquired before having made a plethora of trips back to Europe but I guess most what I did, was optimal and what should have been done. Except, I just feel that, there is still somewhat little control over what I actually really do in life.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Back to it, eh?</h4></center>
    So? Australia huh? This land and continent, most of it at least, doesn't quite keep surprising me. I mean, it's still heavily influenced by the British. Cosmopolitan and unique in its own form. The flora presents itself with washed out colours. The fauna just mostly tries to kill you. But that's not the only thing that will in Australia. Apparently drugs are a huge problem here. I guess I don't quite need them, though, ever since life turns out to be quite frequently crazy enough, travels heavily stimulating, there are other ways in how one might chill and in terms of phases, I guess I am one myself.

    So how about I just go vaguely through the places I have visited quite recently, or maybe make a short summary to begin of how I managed in the last couple of weeks?<br><br>

    The entire trip back was crafted in a way, as to which I would be able to get back in time for my research project to kick off, so that I could spend relatively less but still see probably and hellovalikely more. Like I said, if not now then when? And so, the trip included:<br><br>

    - Making my way from KAIST do Daejeon KTX (turned out to be Bus station)<br>
    - From KTX (Bus station) make my way to Daegu (KTX/Bus)<br>
    - From Daegu (KTX/Bus) make my way to Daegu Airport<br>
    - From Daegu fly to Osaka-Kansai<br>
    - Take the train from Osaka-Kansai to Kyoto<br>
    - Take the bus to the Capsule hotel by Bus<br>
    - Explore the shit out of Kyoto<br>
    - Take the metro back to Kyoto station<br>
    - Train from Kyoto to Osaka Kantai Airport<br>
    - Fly from Osaka Kantai to Kuala Lumpur Airport<br>
    - Take a train to the city<br>
    - Explore the shit out of the city<br>
    - Get back to the train station<br>
    - Take the train to Kuala Lumpur airport<br>
    - Fly from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne<br>
    - Take the Bus from Melbourne Airport to the city center<br>
    - Explore the city center (and charge batteries!!!)<br>
    - Explore the city<br>
    - Take somewhat a tram back and walk to the train station<br>
    - Take the train from Melbourne Southen Cross to Campbelltown<br>
    - Get from Campbelltown to Minto<br><br>

    Feels a bit more clear now? There are more details, but basically: Daejeon-Daegu-Osaka-Kyoto-Kuala Lumpur-Melbourne-Sydney, more or less.<br><br>

    <center><h4>South Korea</h4></center>
    My last day at KAIST was... well, it ain't was a day, literally a few hours. I made sure everything was packed etc. I even got up without my alarm ringing. A little startled still, as I was literally bankrupt for a few days, I checked whether my money pulled through... omg, it did. Citibank did a number on me this time, as it took over a full 48h to check a bank transfer, something that I did not expect to happen. I usually apply a system, which keeps me and my resources in check. Long story short, I have an account for international travels and this one will usually hold a rather smaller amount of money, just in case that I don't go crazy, no sorts of fraud could affect me substantially, so that I can control myself and so that if I ever get intoxicated a bit too much, I really won't do anything too crazy. It never really happens but hey, murphy and stuff, so better keep it organised. This time the tables have turned a bit and here I was, a day before heading back home, with 1.75$ on my account. I guess citibank decided to make a laugh on me, although I was the one who should have kept close attention to my finances as money gets siphoned fast in Korea.<br><br>

    This morning everything turned out quite fine. I got up, did my thing as any morning, prepared, started marching out little, maybe more before 8 and checked out. A thing as straightforward as to telling which room you were at and pointing at a pile holding your pillow, sheets and cover. This was it. KAIST came to an end. Now, time to eat I guess at the cafeteria and meet a friend who's rolling back same as I am? This was literally the max, as many students have left on or after the 28th of July. It became so quiet, vacated that it just hit me right in the feels. Nostalgia of enormous amounts, despite that I didn't really get to know all these people here, primarily due to all the work that had to be done, as how packed the summer program was. But I knew, that a great majority of the people who did attend the Summer School, were a really great, friendly bunch. All of us were really, after all. Eventually that kicked off, especially after the first week went.<br><br>

    And so, the breakfast was as breakfast. At the cafeteria. I had the typical Korean mix of dishes, consisting primarily of meat and pickled veggies. My friend had a wrap, as the Cafeteria was under siege from a great number of... who was it again? Young, high school students willing to get to KAIST? Young scientists? Yeah, KAIST really made a name for themselves and with time you start to see what studying at the best Korean Technical University really is. Not just in terms of how demanding the workload is but the name stands firm and everyone in South Korea will know the institution by its name.<br><br>

    It was really sad to leave all this. Especially that I got to know the campus better with time. At first glimpse, holding nothing. I don't even know what to compare it to. It literally is an old complex but it's built to feature everything that a student might need and want to do. A high-tech, meticulously well-design Library, that makes you want to read and study? Rehearsal rooms to play instruments? A room to chill and play piano? A bar to have a few beers (that I did not manage to visit :'()? How about Karaoke? A pizza place? Wanna play pool? Or Badminton? Ping-pong? Basketball? Buy a bicycle and sell it after you leave? This time I was though and for good. A little bit further down from campus, you had a town that could be truly called a Hong-Kong. But I have never been to Hong-Kong and in fact, I have not seen such a flashy cluster of neons in my life. This entire country is built in a way, that you don't see much until you get exploring the details. Literally all the best places were hidden on various floors of buildings. The competition feels so fierce as in in no other city I have visited and they seem to manage, especially with the interior design I kept on stumbling upon.<br><br>

    We took a cab to Daejeon Bus Station. It felt as if it was taking us the wrong direction. But it was me how was at a wrong, especially once it made its way closer, unravelling a painful experience of me getting lost in this city. It was really crazy the other night. It takes usually over 2 hours to get my foot from Daejeon KTX station, I know this, I made this journey a few times, as there are no night buses in Daejeon and I was too stingy to pay a taxi. The bus station in theory is closer. And I was doing well but decided to bounce back from doing well due to my hunch that there must be somewhere a river that I never crossed. Ultimately, spending an entire night at a highrise university building located somewhere in the eastern part of Daejeon. Oh well. This time, at the terminal, there was a problem with paying by card. Literally, at no bus terminal in South Korea, was I able to pay by card. So what I had to do, go find a 7-eleven to withdraw fee-free money. I reached one 7-eleven, with the right Lotte ATM but the establishment closed. I ran to the next one, with the wrong ATM and then the next, that had what I needed. Enough cash to get us both moving, in seperate directions<br><br>

    South Korea is a gorgeous country. One might easily fall in love with all these mountain chains, hills, rivers and lakes. Just how wonderfully it is all arranged and composed with urbanised areas, infrastructure and literally just highrises popping out of nowhere. This is a country with a population, well not that radically larger than Poland, but highrises popping out of nowhere was news, culture shock let's say to me. And then they've got a shitton in cities, especially Seoul of which metro hosts half the country. I'll put it again, half - the - country. This is impressive by any standards. This is almost like the entire population of Australia. It's scary a bit. What if the war between Koreas goes out? I'm not sure if a humanitarian catastrophe of such both large-small scale ever really happened.<br><br>

    I was looking forward to exploring Daegu but it turned out I would have not had enough time, so I just looked around their massive complex pertaining of a train station, bus terminal, shopping mall, a park and who the hell knows what else was there. I actually got lost a few times so I really had to pick up the pace to get to the airport. And there, the quite straightforward check-out process, me leaving my luggage, going through the processes, I think I had a toast or two, quite interesting as they were sweet and salty. And voila, I'm out of Korea.<br><br>

    Okay, time for Japan vol. 2. Actually 3, as I managed to visit two cities so far: Osaka and Fukuoka. Especially the latter turned out as surprising, nothing quite special but I should have made more ground-up research beforehand, as I honestly thought I'd be hitting a town or something. Hesus, how wrong was I, especially after departing to Korea, when I took 6 minutes of a mesmerising cityscape. But still, there wasn't too much but the food was honestly quite good. Although, Osaka was king at the time.<br><br>

    So there was Osaka and now time for... Kyoto, was it? I had a little bit over a day, likely amounting to two. Many have especially recommended me visiting Kyoto. Even Tripadvisor said: go to Kyoto, cause there's nothing in Osaka. Well, I still loved Osaka. It was just this crush against my own vision and expectations with a view of something that was truly different but great on its own to the extent that made me think, whether living in this country wouldn't be a great idea now. Now, imagine how different Kyoto could be, that it sort of did the very same number on me, except it was again radically different from Osaka now. But in the end, it sort of almost become my favorite city, I would verify this if only I had more time.<br><br>

    So, the rolling in process was almost same as before, quite straightforward. Just, at immigration, this time it took slightly longer, as I was being shown: 'hey man, do you have any of those?', paraphrasing of course but asked in such ridiculously calm tone by the lady checking me, that I just almost as ridiculously replied 'no I don't have any of those', with following questions asked in relation to whether I have any gold, if she could see my bag 'which one?', 'this one', my wallet, which she cleaned before inspecting, asking questions which time was it for me in Japan etc. Then I went through, had to withdraw money from 7-eleven bank, get into a long queue to get my Haruka ticket to Kyoto, pack myself into a train once it got cleaned and Ohayo Japan! Once again, now what the hell am I supposed to see in this country?<br><br>

    Yeah, so I should have remembered they had these pages or sth for visiting Kyoto, although I sat at the first row and didn't have the opportunity to see them at first. Especially with the amount of luggage I was carrying on my back and forth(back?). Tripadvisor said, 'hey man, you've got temples here'. 'Okay man, what else you got'. 'Well... temples. And tours.', 'No tours, show me something interesting'. 'Well, we've got temples...'. Yeah, actually at first that was not the first impression I received but I definitely saw, that there is plenty to visit in this city and wondering as to whether I will be able to see it all. I did a bit of research this time beforehand but once I entered Kyoto, well, heck, again they've got a garganteously monumental train station. I don't honestly know what's with Japanese and their train stations but if there was a special type of temple mankind could build, well, here you go. These places are truly mega and to try to illustrate that, I was looking for food in the area and it recommended me a place... on the 11th floor of the station, which still took me 15 minutes to figure out how to reach it. And on my way back I could not find easily from where my train was departing, again around 20 minutes of wandering around. And still, the foodplace was surrounded by people queuing up to eat, so I had to leave to get some sleep.<br><br>

    Okay mate. Homeplus. I was told there are two supermarkets down from KAIST campus and that it takes quite a while to get there so I should take... a taxi to reach it. That's right folks, people at KAIST use taxis to go places! And I'm not joking, you can even use your T-money card to pay for the journey, which apparently is quite cheap, especially if you travel in groups. In fact, I was told that Uber is more expensive than taxis (!!!). So if you travel in groups, the fee comes down to around 1000 KRW, ain't hefty at all so the convenience probably in combination beats all the other options. There are many cycle paths, which are especially well developed along the riversides. But all the pedestrians... don't give a few flying green teas about this, so they just wander through those and, in theory, I don't blame them, as it seems that cyclists were prioritised here. Still, in general I am seeing that propriety, at least in the city, is quite quite mixed. And again, I will have to foreset a distinction between Korea and Japan, with the latter turning out as, well, turbo pleasant. I will showase Japan in one of the later blogs as it is really one topic that just shifted how I imagined this country and which exceeded in expectations in a myriad of ways, making it one of the countries that I could potentially be looking forward to even living in. But yeah, here in Korea, in theory everything is very well organised. But in practice, it... just works.<br><br>

    Not quite as intended that is. The cars won't stop till you pass the street. People won't hold the door for you if you follow them. People won't line up to access a train. Pedestrians use cycle paths. I mean, all these are just small things and being pleasant to others is somewhat encoded actually into this culture from what I know but, well... Okay, Homeplus! So that's an interesting venue. See, when I say a supermarket I mean a place like, Woolworths or Coles in Australia, which are probably one of the largest supermarkets you'll likely come across. In Germany, some equivalents could be counted as Tangelmann, maybe Edeka and partially even Lidl nowadays. In Poland, we have probably shops like Biedronka, also Lidl, Tesco... there are many more but these are the supermarket-sized places, in general, okay? Now, in Korea the supermarket I went to, called Homeplus was... a hypermarket, which reminded me of such that I came across in... Poland, exclusively. Now, in order to imagine this more vividly, take a regular supermarket and blow it out of propotion by twice or three times in size. Chuck in everything that you may ever need to buy with some selection and... voila, this is were you can buy bread, sweets and meat but also a microwave, bicycle and a smartphone if you really feel like it's a good idea. Now the one in Korea is... huge and it actually primarily features... hardware. Like 2/3 of the store is hardware and 1/3 is actual food. In Poland, I'd argue it's usually 50/50 or 2/3 food, 1/3 hardware. In Poland, you have Auchan, Carrefour, even Kaufland to some extent and there may be more that are somewhere at the back of my head. I'm still surprised that these shops in Poland still withstand the fierce competition and it literally did get extremely crowded in recent years. But that's for another blog. Here on the other hand, Homeplus does get crowded too and it seems that it's binded with Tesco. There are many small stalls were they give out tasters. And in case of hardware stalls, there are many advisors recommending their products. It feels more like a hypermarket entailing a variety of traders, who advertise their merchandise - which gives an idea of a simple market.<br><br>

    The prices are relatively low, although it is very hard to get a grasp on how much you are actually spending in this country. Literally, adjusting to a new system always takes time and it's just eventually that gets to your head what you're actually eating, how much you are eating and subsequently how much you're spending. Still, many drinks go for 1000 KRW, larger ones for 2000 KRW. In such case I see a distinction between convenience stores and this particular hypermarket, which is not that severe as prices in convenience stores are maybe ~50% higher. It is a distinction but not so severe to make frequent trips to the store placed far away. There are many stalls where they sell food that they make on site, which is nice. What pains me though, is that there is not such a huge variety of foods available in terms of, idk, local sweets for instance. There are many imported products and such that are just sold by giants. I saw European beers, chocolate, biscuits and sweets. Same went for cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, that's actually cool but I was counting on more distinct stuff. And in this terms, the sweets were quite underwhelming and surprisingly low-quality. Perhaps I don't what what to eat then? There was not a large selection of fruits either, which were quite expensive too. What pained me for a bit the most, though, was that certain products were, as if, missing. I could not find any body wash, which is a standard for me, I just don't like using soap bars. In Australia or Europe, there is a large selection of those, in Korea, I hardly could find one. Body lotions on the other hand? Tons available.<br><br>

    There is a large selection of teas and juices/water based on infusions from teas, cocoa and other stuff that I don't quite get the taste. Some of it I began to stop drinking, as was purely sugar. And in case of sweets, I got stuffed with those in Japan and Korea and I think I'll stop as the quality is too varied and these are empty calories after all. Most of it is quite distinct, though. I will provide some more information once I actually try a bit of this and that. Ice cream is relatively expensive and underwhelming surprisingly. Also, convenience stores are usually packed, especially 7/11 which are a God send, since their ATMs do not incur fees on my end (citibank life!).<br><br>

    Still, the way how they compress these venues... amazing but does everything really sell?<br><br>
