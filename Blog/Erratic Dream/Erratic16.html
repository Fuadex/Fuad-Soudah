    <center><h4>Chasing Time</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      An idea I had, as my friend had to work, perhaps I could push my flight and make a bit of time so we could travel somewhere. One idea was Aachen, as it was very much encouraged by another friend who studied in Munster and had the opportunity to travel heaps around. Aachen was supposed to be the most beautiful city in RFN and as my friend did not visit it yet, it seemed like the obvious approach. I thought of adding Bonn to the list, as it was kind of on the way back. But I was open to suggestions and I was willing to stuff as much as possible in my short, although eventually I thought a bit too prolonged stay.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so in the end, Aachen it was.
    </p>

  <center><h4>Old Capital</h4></center>
    
  <p>
    So at first I had a bit of a background knowledge about where we're heading. Apparently an old capital of Germany, supposed to be beautiful and still in a preserve state, of how it was that it remained. We took a train early in the morning. From what I recall, I had some jetlag (oh, another thing that makes my mind melt!) so I think I managed to wake up quite ever earlier than needed. The trip took a bit over an hour, during which I enjoyed the sunrise and the friend took a bit of a nap. Once we reached it, we went a bit admiring the station and then making a stop by a bank branch, which we could not access for a while. Then back on track, we went by a... I couldn't say Aachen was a very beautiful city at this point. It was fine but nothing out of the ordinary which I expected to change but it didn't quite. We reached likely the main tourist attraction which was the cathedral, a very peculiar one, as it was a merger of a variety of styles as the construct was being developed in recurrently at different times. So you have the medieval style, I think there was Baroque, had some Gothic/Neo-Gothic touch to it but frankly, it was just a little bit of everything and it did look quite rich inside. On the outside, quite cool to see something like this. In the end though, it was hardly a cathedral, more like a reinforced chapel. But that's just me, I was hoping for a bit more cultural fireworks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Afterwards, I just figured we could pierce through the city/town, through the major supposedely heritage-seeming areas and as I figured Aachen should have an orientation point, like a hill or sth, I quickly discovered that hell, it actually does have one. And so we ended up in a park, which I felt as it was looking really good. With a handful of very high trees climbing into the sky and plentiful of autumn colours rashing over my ever-needing for nature eyes. A good time to wind down and just enjoy a bit of the natural part of Aachen. I mean it can always be even better than that but there was some view, scathed by a morning fog but still nice to stroll around. After a bit, we went down the hill, through a park and figured perhaps grabbing a bit of food or coffee could be an idea and so we reached a cafe. Which wasn't a special cafe but it was yet another good cafe where you could wind down a bit. And then we bounced off a Brasilian shop, where I acquired a bottle of, was it, cheap Brasilian wine? But sweet it was! And after consuming it on our way, we reached a local museum, as if built into an ex-fire station, where there was a decent mixture of well, international and contemporary art. Then we strolled back, held by a Currywurst place and and beers, and a bakery where I equipped myself with a pack of so-called Printen, as if local gingerbreads with a bit of a twist. Oh, we also visited a small museum where applied art of... was it biedermeier was showcased? We had some plans to maybe reach a form of a (national?) park afterwards or Bonn but due to actually both of us, our decreasing health, we just went back and... wait, I think we went somewhere in Cologne still on that evening.
  </p>

<p>
  I think it was a bit in the area, getting some microgroceries. And then walking by some more quirky, run-down areas... and reaching... a Mosque. This is actually an interesting theme, visiting a Mosque would be the last thing on my mind that I would think of visiting in Cologne. In relevance, we also had falafel (?) shawarma I think that day and I got to learn of the difference between what a shawarma and a kebab is. But the Mosque itself, it was... beautiful. I haven't seen many Mosques in my life but that was a very modern looking building and we had the opportunity to also enter it and see a bit more from the inside as a few Kosovians let us in who were just leaving it and were open for any questions we might have been having. I think there is a little bit of history revolving around this particular Mosque, from what I know quite recently raised and from what I learned, also financed by the Turkish government. There is a tendency for Mosques to be financed by foreign states, for Turkey it would make sense due to the large Turkish diaspora in Germany, there is also Saudi Arabia which seems to be eager to a bit of financing themselves. I think there's a bit of opposition rising in relation to Mosques being built and practically lead by people appointed from abroad but still, it was veeery interesting to see this particular one, because of just how modern and just how good it looked. Apparently, in terms of the service, it's also different to many of those held in the middle east. It's just a bit of my own thoughts here, it was one of the things on the list that my friend wanted to show me here in Cologne.

    <center><h4>Overall</h4></center>

  <p>
    I think that was more or less it so far. I think I got criticised for not eating much, which was a fair point, as a guest I probably shouldn't restrain myself from eating all the time actually. But it wasn't quite restraint, as it was the combined currywurst and veal from Aachen + the sickness that was getting to me and which was to remain by me for the following 2 weeks and preserving even while I was already back after then in Australia, I just didn't feel any hunger whatsoever, pushing me to apologize for the situation and many more in between. I'm not sure if I've mentioned that yet. I have survived through a wide variety of travels that were equipped with such details that I honestly didn't think I could pull such stunts off. Like not sleeping for 2 days, etc. But it seems I keep on pushing the ledge further and further, as if it was an edge becoming and conforming into a ledge. And as it's being magically formed and pushed back by me taking and flexing with the next steps, I always have the feeling that this time, this will be just an edge of the ledge, from which I will just drop and get really mauled in the process, to such a point that there will be no turning back to how it was. This time, it wasn't so bad, except, once I merged all the problems I had to deal with, many of physical nature, mental weariness, the illness, jetlag and many more. I mean I was a barrel of wet gunpowder. Not able to explode, languid, kind of worthless. In different circumstances, there would have been a much better use of me. But just considering what I am doing to myself with all these travels, not caring about the state I was in and hoping for the best, sometimes it becomes much more than I expected. And sometimes it's just as much but not quite.
</p>

<p>
  The next day I figured I'm going to drop by Bonn, very early in the morning. And that's exactly what I've done as the jetlag got me awake very early. And so I took a very early train and pop, there I was, exploring right before sunrise the city, more of a town of Bonn. Cologne and Bonn have an interesting structure of a duo-city. You can reach either by train or even a connecting tram and probably they should have some sort of buses too. Bonn seemed much smaller... but it was nice and quaint. Yet another cathedral and really nice one too, alike to what I've seen in Aachen. I think I passed by a bit of a newly constructed (?) Operahouse. Passed by people rising to life and setting up local stalls. Taken pictures by the riverside of the sun rising, which I found to be really nice here. The only place open around 6, was well, bakeries. But I figure I'm gonna remain on empty stomach so I could actually eat later with my friend. So I took around 2 hours to explore and it was just about enough. What tripadvisor didn't quite tell me, was that the famous part of Bonn, which gets filled in amazing colors during Spring, is actually quite large and it is the oldtown. Despite it was deprived of all the leaves, all the trees set along the oldtown's streets, I could easily picture how these cherry blossoms amaze all the people coming through, living here and visiting as tourists. Thinking back at how it was in Cologne with the Korean trees and how magnificent the colours composed in one's retina, here you had tens, maybe hundreds in rows. And the architecture, was also something nice to keep your eyes peeled on. I walked for a bit longer, exploring and visiting a nearby REWE shop and as I tanked on Spezi, Gerolsteiner and juices, I started going back and upon discovering the time my next train was coming, I stared even sprinting, eventually turning up back in Cologne.
</p>

<p>
  Here, I met my friend. Can't recall if already up, I think already up. Discussing a bit and then figuring, that she need to do some work for a bit. So I figured, okayyy, gotta go and see a museum in Cologne now! As it's about to be opened... And as weirdly it seemed there were no good public transport options and it was in theory faster to get there by foot, that's what I've just done. A bit scared by my friend's news the museum's going to cost me 15 Euros (that's almost freakin' as much as Rijksmuseum, probably the most expensive museum I've been to!), I was pleased to hear it was actually 8. We actually showed up here the other day, like 15 minutes before the museum closing down. We were not let in so... Yeah, this time I did get in. And it was a good idea because it was a really good, decent contemporary art museum. A mixture of a variety of styles but again like K20, it was curated in a very fine manner. There was a bit for everyone to get engaged and enjoy what they were engaged by. The selection was pretty and it extended even into more contemporary fine art forms, photography... many of which I just found to be good. This is a really pleasant discovery as at times you just show up at museums, which are at best just average. Around here, the museums I've been to, I couldn't say much against them, especially I praised K20 and this one, Museum Ludwig. A quite massive complex with plentiful of natural light. After around an hour and a half of peeking at all the corners of it, I've decided to take yet another stroll back now. And I did it through and around some interesting and quieter corners of this city. My memory card started acting up in my smartphone, though so I restrained myself from taking too many pictures at this point. And once I reached back, it was the culmination of my Colognial trip.

    <center><h4>Bibimbap</h4></center>

<p>
  My friend kept on asking me what kind of food would I want to eat. Keeping being undecisive, cause my brains didn't quite work well anymore, in the end I figured, you know what? Korean, as we got to know each other in Korea and I am curious how they do Korean in Germany. That's cheap now that I think about it. But the Bibimbap was alright plus I think I had ordered something extra, just can't recall exactly... oh it was like a Korean sushi, gimbap. I had even a bit too much ordered in the end. But that's also a symptom of my undecisiveness. My friend, despite of all the work she has and had, did see me off at the airport. And that was it from Germany pretty much. Oh, we also visited the cafe in the building that I was crashed in. I really wanted to see it, as I passed so many times by it and it looked so inviting, which it proved to be. I ordered a form of a cold cafe, don't mind me, I'm crazy, being sick and sipping on this. Or was it not cafe but cold cacao? Or chocolate? Doesn't matter now.
</p>

<p>
  What I was most surprised by was just how much I felt at home. To consider Germany home, it's a very interesting feeling. I've been living in Munich for a while after all and Cologne was my first time, so that's even more of a weird feeling/discovery after all. As I've mentioned once, just how much I was able to understand of people speaking in German. Me being able to still have some form of command of it despite not using it for so long. Extremely satisfying feeling. And Germans not automatically switching all the time to English, I think some of you may relate. A lot of the cuisine and products that I was coming across and knowing, even me spending primarily money held on my German bank account. But primarily what I felt as so positive, just how welcoming and positive and pleasant all the people that I came across just were. It might seem surprising but even complete strangers just interacting between one another. So simple but pure and something I did not quite see on my next days in Poland. It was completely different when I interacted with family and friends, all of 'em just great to be with and again, feeling so welcome. But Germany felt different in a way. Just that I travelled and despite really being in a foreign country, it just didn't feel that foreign after all. Which at times makes me think whether it could be a good idea to go back and finish my Master's degree in Munich. Which I have potential to do and really enclose in just 2, tops 3 semesters. It's just simply amazing how all my past actions managed to form into some specific growth form, from which new opportunities to discover the world just simply become.
</p>

<p>
  Although in the end, I wasn't sure whether I have picked the right time to arrive here after all.
