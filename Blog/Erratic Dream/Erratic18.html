      Returning to Australia always provides me with a wide array of feelings that I usually sum up as a confluence, resulting in me not feeling anything. As dangerous as ever, a rubric's cube unattended won't solve itself and I had amassed quite a bit to deal with in my head. There were practically three things I counted on, that related highly to how my future will unwind. One was a miss, one hit me hard once I reached Singapore and the third did not arrive to that very day. You can imagine how that can affect a person mentally and how much all of this can skew the perception of a lone traveller, especially one that was quite looking forward to discovering a bit more of a city that I kept in high praise of.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was also quite severely ill at this point. To a degree in which from my experience, I could potentially be hospitalized. Like I mentioned a while back, I gamble a lot with my travels, in fact it is a sort form of gambling. There is a lot to gain but also to lose and it all depends on you, hollistically, on how this all will turn out.

    This was a long-haul flight, one that took quite some effort on my end. The lack of sleep before my departure from Poland, a bit of stress and again hardly much sleep between Thessaloniki and Athens and then surviving through my remaining time till I packed myself into the aircraft. At which point you figure falling asleep will become rather an automatized process but with the turbulances I imposed on my day-night and sleeping schedule, all of a sudden, getting to the right state to close my eyes and fade my conscious mind away becomes a hurdle that eventually reaches its predestined goal but with hardly much efficiency that you'd really hope for achieving. That having said, this was the connection I have chosen. Even filling in the compensation form at the airport took me quite some effort, making sure all the details introduced were actually correct. At some point a person starts to doubt self in relation to whether what's perceived is actually true. On one hand, when you're completely well-rested, then you can perform tasks quite neatly but still once you get back to take another look at some other point, you may realise there were things you could have performed better or see things that are in need of fixing. In case of a person who had hardly any rest and was in a state, in which every single hour and a half of sleep is of critical essence, you may imagine how perception starts to shift along with the feeling of time flowing and what you think of accomplishing but actually do and perceive the executed state. But that's just a bit of background of me getting to Singapore and of course I had to survive around 22 hours of my presence there. Mind, a complete shift in climate, yet another but this time towards humid and hot states. And then shortly after a big personal news-related mental hit but I'll get later to that.
</p>

<p>
  I've reached Changi at around 4:30 in the morning. Again, going through customs n' all was quite straightforward, perhaps it's just my impression that the security measures in this city-country are fairly lax but also the system seems well constructed and laid out, in a way that is just optimized and a bit more convenient for the passengers as opposed to other airports that I've gone through. The only issue that I had was the public transport not working just yet and most of the places being quite closed shut at this time, as expected. In addition, my key devices were semi-charged like my smartphone, key to getting around the city and even my watch was slowly getting to the point of getting overly depleted from what I recall. There was still not much that I could do at such early hours, so I got some Malaysian food, fairly okay too and then once I got all my stuff in a bit better shape, I could catch the first train/metro with crowds feeling like the same after squatting for sometime. It seems that the hours were even additionally affected due to some works being conducted. And then once I hopped on the train, oh well, it was raining after all. This time I was hoping of exploring a little bit more of the western side of the main tourist area with the addition of some museums. I did not quite get in contact with some of the people I know on time so I had to go in blind. Apparently there are some shrines and more culturally distinct areas around. Also, I just had to discover the famous park and check a few museums if feasible. So... taking into account all that... I started by going straight close to the Marina Bay and finding out what this Supertree Grove is really all about during the day.
</p>

<p>
  On the map it all looks so tiny but me venturing through this park took actually quite some time, especially that I decided to pierce along through this area. Doing so, took me a good around an hour but I've been already happy by doing so. Singapore in the morning has a very interesting feel to it. Hardly anyone's on the streets, it wasn't raining anymore but the afterrain aura affected the city in a quite refreshing manner. The Lilles around the Art Science Museum were still closed and so were all the shops and venues around. And therefore, the park itself had hardly any bipeds scouring the area, except for myself, a few alike and people working but not too many of them. So it was just me, the exotic selection of civilized vegetation and the abundant wildlife doing its things in the morning. If Singapore can be cold an oasis due to its greenery spanning through the city, this park itself could be called yet another Oasis within the already quite impressive Oasis. And I mean, this is not their only park, in fact it's one of the smaller ones that Singapore seems to have. Still, one of the most notorious and recognised destinations which seems to attract a massive amount of toursists as I would later find out. At this point I just needed to get some directions and so I set up my phone up and running with a bit of internet and found my results to have been published, which got me into a bit of a morbid mood.

  <p>
    It's a bit sad to see countless hours of work being flushed down the drain amounting to a rather average looking grade that as I felt completely sat in disarray from the amount and quality of work that were actually delivered. But what even more bothered me at that time, was that yet another window seemed to have been closed tightly shut, although not necessarily, severely complicating things for future works and streams that I might have hoped of getting myself into. So with that levels of uncertainty and hopes in the process of evaporation, right in the middle of a beautiful scorching hot oasis, I had to chill for a moment, indulge in the beauty of the how mesmerising comprisal of subliminal elaboration of simplicity, unhindered by the ambience of failure and uncertainty revolving around my mauled mind and worn down physical state. The perception might have shifted for a moment but then after taking my strolls around, passing by the grand variety of greens that I would have liked to see in many parts of the world I've strolled just the same, I made my way up and through the ship-on-a-building construct, that lead me a bit astray, through a bit of a rooftop-like maze, pushing me out through an actively now being opened stores within an en-built mall. I decided to eat something here and as I couldn't find anything of particular interest, I just got myself a rather expensive bowl of Laksa. Something much over 10 SGD, that amounted to a poorly tasting soup with a ridiculously small amount of additionally ordered prawns. Then I tried freshly squeezed juice for yet another ~5 SGD and then I bailed, appalled by how bad and yet expensive all of that was.
</p>

<p>
  My very next stop was the Art Science museum, as I figured that could be a good spot to unwind. One of the side effects of me receiving bad news and feeling down is a bit of a more reflective predisposition that I acquire, that I very much like actually, putting me in an awkward position of me needing to choose whether I should fill blissful and lightheadedness into my life or a bit of a morbid mixture neverending with good but creating a distinct mixture of something interesting and potentially rewarding. Yep, that's how my mind works in riddles at times. Either way, the Art Science museum was ridiculous in terms of the pricing, with me still getting some of the cheaper tickets but how can you justify spending around 30 SGD on the combination of exhibitions? I assume they need to get all the expenses associated with raising this concrete Lille-like building out of the way but hey, this sets some all-new records for how much I am willing to spend on this. On the other hand, what I received in return was actually quite good, although very limited. One exhibitions touched upon physicists and had a quite powerful display, as in a merger of Art and Science that I was looking forward to seeing. I just liked to see how all this could be put and portrayed in a different perspective and challenged my mind in angles that I have rarely explored nowadays but have known quite some time. The other was a bit more interactive installation that I found as implemented overall poorly, although as always, fun for families. And then a bit of a more new/contemporary art section, which was a bit of a 50/50 for me. Overall cool museum but the setting some new all-highs for how overpriced one actually gets.
</p>

<p>
  Then I took another stroll to a Design museum, much smaller than the other but hosting likely a more elaborate and numerous set of exhibition pieces, which were primarily derived from competition-based work. Some works were quite cool actually but most featured, for some better, at times weakly executed product design features. Which got me wondering, what do these awards amount to and who does give these out based on what criteria. This is not the first time I am having doubts in relation to how such rewards are being distributed and how even the presentation of the product is just quite lacking. The ticketing system was interesting as you would get a voucher and some discounts for the store/cafe located within the building. I figured it all were still overpriced so I moved on towards the western part of the city. At first, needing myself to get a bit caffeinated and somewhere on my way I also decided to take a break at a deckchair. The coffee thing was a bit tricky as I preferred starbucks due to the facilities they usually offer. But as this venue was full, I had to get an average espresso from a chain nearby. Then, I continued to proceed through a cluster of highrise buildings, the real CBD here in Singapore. Although, in fact, to be fair, a bit smaller than I would have imagined it to be right in its very heart.

  Now that's the point Singapore started getting a bit more heritage-based, as the city decided to uncover some of the sites I could not have seen beforehand. A traditional market/eatery area. And then a bit of more highrises married to even more greeneries and then a section that got me quite surprised, as on one street there were religious venues right next to one another. For Buddhists, Muslims, Christians and more. It's kind of nice to see such a multicultural mix, from what it seemed, working quite well here. There were people visiting each and then as I passed by the quite colorful area, I started wondering. That this all seems to look as if left behind, a relict of the past and kind of even kept on purpose here. At some religious venues food was being advertised and offered. That's just controversial, as much as the architectural mix present here which was a little bit of everything but still quite consitent with the French/Italian-like windows and the skyscrapers obscuring the view in the background. I managed to find a way back and deeper into this distinct are as there was more to uncover. At first a bit British combination of venues and pubs attracting tourists and then as I figured, Chinatown... There was a lot of construction work going on and I wanted to really venture out and see as much as possible but also me feet, there's a limit to how much I can really keep on walking here. But I still managed to take a bit of a spin, through this area and pierce through the what it would seem like a very traditional Chinese fervor. This felt like a different Singapore now. I also wanted to see a bit from a hill nearby but there wasn't much of the view and as it turns out, in Singapore, the highest vantage points seem to be occupied by the military. Too bad for me, I figured.
</p>

<p>
  Then it was down back to walking for me with the aim of reaching two different museums. I pierced bit up north and climbed a hill, which took some effort due to my already desolated physical state. Where I discovered yet another army complex built on top. It's even called a fort after all but the scenic route was quite pleasant and overall worth the time, especially that the area was shaded and noticeably quieter. And then I got lost as my orientation went haywire, so I visited a 7/11, rested for a bit and then after managing the directions I found my way to a recommended Singapore Art Museum, which was closed for renovations... but the exhibits apparently moved quite next door. So I did that, with the tickets cheap but having a bit of an issue packing my backpack into a locker storage complex. Then I looked through the rather new art types of exhibits, which left me underwhelmed as I blitzed through the building, afterwards thinking, maybe I still have time to do the other, National Museum of Singapore. That was a good one. Especially that on this day entry was free but I had to get up and running as the closing time was approaching fast. There was a good combination of paintings, digital infusions with projection mappings, bit more specific themes that you don't get to see too often for instance paintings of particular nature i.e. types of trees and flowers from what I recall. I could actually be wrong as it sounds trivial now but the overall presentation and quality impressed me a lot. There were parts with history of Singapore, built in a rather top-notch professional way that I know from some other museums, as it embedded a combination of mock-ups, actual relicts and exhibits, some digital materials and a really exceptionally executed interior design that provided this distinct atmosphere to underline key events in Singaporean history, which I found to be quite an interesting one. The presentation was rich and depleted whatever time I had left to see the museum. Afterwards, I thought I'd see a bit more but the rooms were already closed so up I went to grab my stuff from the locker and... I could not open it. I asked for help and one guard came around, tried to get it open. Then a few other people came around and seeing that the thing does not budge, I just sat down and decided to rest of a moment. I think I even fell asleep there for a moment. At some point I was asked whether I could be sent the bag, as they're not sure whether they can get a guy to crack the lock but considering I was about to be on my way... Around half an hour or longer later, the damned thing actually got opened after the consecutive bashing it received from one of the people working there. After receiving some apologies and me thanking for their help, I made my way to the Supertree Grove once again, as the sun was about to set quite soon.
</p>

<p>
  Just then, I discovered one surprising complex of two buildings. One, with flora. The other too, with flora. Tickets as expensive as the Art Science museum and unfortunately each were to be closed soon so I dropped the idea of hitting the two oasises within an oasis located within yet another oasis. If I ever come back, this is something on top of my list of things to do. Museums may be found in every single corner of the earth, botanic garden too but a multi-storey greenhouse with waterfalls and an even more impressive selection of natural beauty thriving? If there was a single complex to express what Singapore is about and describe its philosphy, that would be it in all lengths. Then I managed to see how the rest of the park looks after dark, as it's sprawling with tourists and a fantastic lightning patterns elicited by the supertrees. Futurism in all its glory and eco-utopian dream brought to reality. After I chilled around here, I moved back to the bay, which was still quite lively. This was a weekend, so people could be found just hanging around, concerts taking place, people having drinks in the park or jogging. Yet another chilling session performed by me, a bit sad I left my hardware back in Poland, as per the intention originally, with my old DSLR and hybrid passed onto my mom who could make a better use of both. And one particular object took my attention. It was a sculpture, of a family. You could find sculptures of notable people all around the world, usually just particular people. At some parts of the world, these would be raised to glorify politicians, idealists, representations of god, the good people, the bad people, the atrocious and good but also less known. Long-forgotten war criminals and pop idols and yesterday's icons. Here, it was just a regular family. Not that far away, there was yet another scultpture of yet another family. And at a seperate destination, a sculpture of what would seem like a bunch of traders and a wagon. This is yet another quite substantial, in my opinion a positive difference that makes Singapore unique, as they recognize the elementar, if not, nuclear core of what brought this nation to what it is today. Nation may be an exaggeration but somehow, some places around the world became highly multicultural and still with a form of scattered, yet tight identities that perhaps do not have such elaborate and extremely deep historical grounding as for instance Poland has but it created an identity for itself and by itself. By diluting themselves by not recognizing anyone but the people who built this city-state to greatness is also a glimpse of the future, as I'd say anywhere in the world, people are more concerned about their own futures and if they could, they would progress and move to something better. Singapore created something better and from my experience, it seemed as a very healthy something where a lot of cogs in the machine just seemed to work, at least from the perspective of a tourist.

  I had to start rolling back. I passed by some people drinking in plain terrain, playing soccer in the park, drinking beers, getting smashed, hanging out, playing guitars. Nothing that would particularly differentiate it from the western world and what I would experience especially in Europe. Joints around were slowly being closed down and as I ventured around I took final glimpses of a quite remarkable destination. Not my favorite from what I've seen in Asia, still, one of particular significance in my eyes as it depicted, as I have recurrently mentioned, the future. In major parts idealistic, it's just how they managed to reach what they wanted which seemed to be in the benefit of all but also working towards the future, which seemed to be somehow embedded in some of their motto of sorts. Even as I ventured through this city-state, I eventually managed to dial down and even forget about the unpleasantness I have encountered just this morning.
</p>

<p>
  On another page, One of the different things about this trip, was having the opportunity to have a glimpse also into other people's lives. How they really live and to some extent even how they were brought up. How different the environment seems to be compared to my own in a variety of lengths. It was really eye opening and having that kind of opportunity is priceless on its own. I feel this should be the second part as an aim of travelling, to discover a bit more behind the facade of what the city offers. Sure there is a lot of what the city wants you to see and then what you end up seeing and discovering. But having the perception of locals guiding you is already a different level and seeing how they're living with all the details that in case of myself, lead to all sorts of comparisons and therefore conclusions is just something, that especially in my case, am truly most of the time while living down under deprived from. Just this perspective, which seems to change everything about your own, processes of thinking, evaluating etc.
