      It's so difficult to work at 6 am in the morning. True, you might be feeling fresh and ready to take on the world but the minute you approach writing without a drop of caffeine, suddenly your mind goes *ueeeghhh* and your body compelled by the hypnotising master, a matrix of synapses goes like and follows 'yeeeeeeaah, maybe going to sleep ain't such a bad idea..'. I know it is and frankly, additional drops of caffeine ain't always going hand in hand with actual effectiveness. Doesn't mean it won't increase my output performance, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as I write those words, they just prove of how relative this world. On one hand, that's a good thing, it brought me up and down so far. But then if everything can be relativised, can we establish universal values anymore? Is there any constant in the world remaining?

  <center><h4>Garden mind</h4></center>
    
<p>
  Let's think back a little. This is yet another issue I'm gonna face: I feel there is a limit bound to how much I can stuff in my head a get away with remembering it all. Humans come across events, those that they wish to remember, those that they don't and those that will stick to them whatever the hosts feelings are like. In my case, it's mostly split between the first two, tilting the scale towards the second type, although at the same time strongly reminding that the first cannot be stown away just yet. And the reason for this, is that I have too many memories to yet relive. The problem remains, how to picture them and how do I establish the right angle and details that do become hazier with time.
</p>

<p>
  Although clashing with my current state of mind and the resources I've gathered so far, what's the point of travelling overall? Especially with my sort of trips, which are like a blitz. There were a number and from each a new was conceived. I love the concept of building upon what you already know. It means you're progressing and developing a specific field that may be in a way unique, once considered in conjunction with other elements that form into one. I also care about presentation. But I also like a bit of innovation. And so with Singapore, I feel some of these words already expressed enough of what I feel about this city and how it presented to me as an Asian crown, although would feel more like a gateway to the world and one that is of particular charm and marvel.
</p>

<p>
  But for me to really portray it and coalesce, I guess I need to attach a proper order to it all. So let me just give a glimpse of what my background situation was: 2 day prior I fell terribly sick, to make matters worse my day of departure marked my day of capstone project aka thesis submission. For the past last weeks, in constant hatching process and of course not submitted in time. Singapore, was just one, merely short 7h 15m stop, even extra more than 3 hours shorter as the last connecting train(metro?)/bus was before midnight and a metro ride takes approx. an hour from the main tourist area. So realistically, I had less than 3 hours in the city, at least on my way to Europe where I had an even crazier and less organised schedule. In fact, my entire trip lacked at even hinch of organization: booked frantically due to an unbelieavable 678AU$ return deal to Athens. From there, I needed to make my way to Poland, which I did via Germany. And I didn't take a single comprehensive look at what I was supposed to visit, I went through a number of travelling arrangements but this was as casual, reckless and stupid as it gets. As I soon was about to discover, my mind was also burnt. This was a trip I shouldn't have taken but ever since I associate travel with a universal value I place at the peaking top of my core, Freedom for which I'm willing to sacrifice it all, I feel being a bit dysfunctional and ill won't stop me from completing yet another form of a fast-approaching and not-so-suddenly evading dream.

    <center><h4>Arrival</h4></center>

<p>
  My usual first problem that I come across when arriving at a place which I did not inspect beforehand is the lack of knowledge of where the fuck I should be heading. At times ending with me squandering anywhere between 15 minutes to over an hour of figuring out 'so what's next'. This time, miraculously my illness came down, which I suspected eventually to have been an infection due to an insect bite. Daaangerous considering I'm in Australia and stuuupid considering I did not inspect it further and extreeeemely stupid, considering I was travelling and the costs associated with any sudden hospitalisation would likely end up with me being, oh bankrupt? I needed a ridiculous amounts of water and it helped that my low cost Scoot airline turned out to be chartering flights from Singapore Airlines and so we had everything onboard. But I also ended up working in-flight, so I could finish my final work, on borrowed time. I eventually arrived at Changi (airport)... And I also discovered that they're really against drugs in this country. I mean, all I had was antibiotics but if I had any commonly illicit, I could find my life being ended sooner than I would see my sentence for my final paper. But coming off the airplane and into the outer part of the terminal was quite straightforward. And as it turned out, coming into the supposedly closed off departure part of the airport comes as easily. Changi has an interesting and efficient system imho. Even if the airport at first didn't make an impression of world's best it had some nice features, like international powersockets, free tours if you didn't leave the transit area (I didn't do that) and a... kinetic art wall, which was something that stunned me upon returning to the airport: knew of something like this but haven't ever seen such a magical thing that is just a way of thinking in a complete other dimension. To create it. It envision it.
</p>

<p>
  And then the obvious bad that there ain't anything open after midnight so that automatically places the airport far below my favorites, along with public transport ceasing to operate between midnight and 6, even earlier and later than that. I understand people need to sleep but man, I think some exceptions should always be in place. But for the few hours I had in the city, coming out was the right decision. To which I was lead by the nose a bit by getting ripped off by an ATM (and I didn't have had to be), told off by my own bank for being poor (Citibank only allowed withdrawals of 100 SGD, what would I do with so much money?) and being kindly helped by a lady at the booth by having my 50 exchanged into smaller nominations. I got a two-way metro card for 2.60 (that's bloody cheap!) and off I went by a connecting metro line. I received some advise from a friend from Singapore that I met in Korea and so I followed her advise, starting from Bugis I made my way downtown. But I got lost at Bugis in the maze of interconnected layered shopping malls. Since I was tired and thirsty, I figured it'd be a good idea to explore a... supermarket. Hay, don't judge. It's a good way to discover a country, by getting to know what they sell and how they sell it. For instance, I would have never imagined to see so many Australian products at a Singaporean supermarket. They had milo, tim tams, nudie juices and milkshakes. There were also Japanese and Korean products too, in fact most of the ones I've seen in-store were international brands. At the same time, they were relatively comparable or cheaper... good news to me + I did get some weird but amazing ice tea and soon was to discover that hell, it's not easy to find a bin here.
</p>

<p>
  I did come to a few realisations very soon in the country. First, a bit sad realisation when I was served by a, what I'd figure a Singaporean figure at the supermarket. Smaller posture, significantly older woman. Speaking from what I've seen, fluently in, I guess Malay... and then I can't recall exactly but I think it was also fluently in English... but British English. I didn't quite know how to put it, in conjunction with all the international produce I was thinking, this is a post-colonial country. Do they actually have an identity here? After all, they even have a fusion the younger people use - Singlish. Upon learning a bit more, Singapore is a real multiethnic enclave, mostly consisting of Chinese descendents with a Malaya minority and even lesser Indian. Geopolitically, I started framing it, as in hm. Apparently this area is important internationally, interesting to see such a high number of Chinese descendants. Also, this city has over 5.6 million people living in it. Yes, the territory might not seem large... But frankly it is. Sure you can cross it entirely by metro in 2 hours... but hey, by foot that's 8. And to do my route, you'll need around 45 minutes each. That was enough to make me brand this city-country, as a highlight of Asia. Well, that happened after I took a little detour.

    <center><h4>Discovery</h4></center>

<p>
  Well... I arrived in the city sometime after 9 PM. After I released myself from the bounds of Bugis and managed to establish which is east and west, swiftly my glance bounced back from a erudite looking neo... neofuturistic elevation. That, and I would even throw in some biological, even molecular references with the addition of projection mapping altering the outlook of its surface. I mean, it was beautiful. I haven't seen that type of architecture in a while, certainly not in that particular configuration. And that wasn't just it. I started to notice the abundance of vegetation sprawling all over and around, along the main alley I started heading once I suffused myself with the eye-clutching construct. After a few minutes spent, I started heading away, as each minute counted as of particular significant. The following minutes were filled, or should I say, I filled myself with the fluids full of Japanese manufactured electrolytes, some other caffeinated brands and me acknowledging that after all this, it might have not been a particularly fantastic idea. Oh, you know what? It was also very, very hot and humid. It was also supposed to rain, which it didn't on evening one and managed to pour down on the morning 2 weeks later. But neither situation was to my benefit, as I was travelling way too light with just a relatively thin, wind-stopping well, more of a jacket than a coat. That was fine to tag along attached to my backpack in Singapore but I was also travelling with my long pants and these have proven a bit bit too much for this weather. As much as I have loved looking at all this sprawling actual urban jungle, whether the jungle didn't primarily consist of concrete but actual living likely subtropical greens, my body reacted in a bit more drowsy-skeptic manner, with the exception of my audio-visual receptors in awe of what they managed to capture, pleasing my brains cause ohhh...
</p>

<p>
  At some point I managed to reach a particular church. It was... it didn't look like a church at first, I've just been seeing cars pulling in n' out, quite good ones too. From what I read and heard, it seems only the rich can afford to get a car in Singapore. In a city-country where every quadratic meter counts, getting your hands on a automobile becomes a luxury and if you can afford such, then you'll likely be able to get a good four wheels along. I decided to investigate what was that object and as it turned out, it was one that my friend recommended taking a look at. This church, was in a way, a life-altering experience. Not at such an extent but as I started discovering that it was not actually a church, it used to but then someone decided to convert it into a restaurant hub. It was a really nice church too, maybe not quite from the inside, a notch modern looking if I remember it correctly, but the facade was rather detailed and rich. A bit victorian, a mix of primarily white and gray rooftop. The restaurants seemed quite fancy... they had naturally waiters who were... watching a football match. Projected right adjacent to the church. A bit of an eye-opening experience in a multicultural habitat, giving a glimpse of, what I believe, the future will be like, as religion progresses to become a cultural relict. At the same time... I wondered. What if it was a Mosque instead. Or any other form of a different sanctum?
</p>

<p>
  After the prompt tour I went back on the track and reached Singapore river, passing a few construction sites and even more vegetation. Now I was at a point where I could see the famous (?) hotel (?) with a ship on its top and even more famous pictures taken from its top, where a pool is located. Yeaaah, it was too far away so I took the scenic route along the river, where a number of local food joints were positioned. It was a nice walk, as the places along felt authentic and local, although representing different cuisines, the weather was nice and the overall feel quite rewarding with quite some illumination dropping against the river's surface. Now I started noticing the CBD... Climbing high, very high... clustered with one building next to the other. It became especially massive once I detoured a bit to a more open area-park where I could establish a wider spectrum of what I was seeing. Right in the middle of a civilised park, next to illuminated bridges and quirky architecture mix of the imperial old and the contemporary massive. And then I started noticing the actual quirky. The visionary and innovative. The prime architecture, the unparalleled beauty. Such that in terms of architecture, I have never seen a better example of a city, which can showcase a more achieving array of absolute stun and dreams forming into reality.

    <center><h4>Well, Here's the thing.</h4></center>

<p>
  Look, the contemporary cities have some sort of a weird convex happening within. The more they want to become better, the larger pressure they need to apply to get that peak a little higher. I don't know whether this metaphor makes sense, probably not so I'll try to picture it differently: every single city wants to become beautiful, innovative and attract tourists. And so they will continue to modernise themselves, often they would at least. But the way they do it, at times just kind of dodges what they intended as a whole, achieving certain points but really regressing in some lengths dramatically. I could give an example of Sydney, where there are investments done in which what they forgot about was the treeeees. Something I started noticing just recently, how really beautiful this city is but only in some parts and surprisingly just the ones still untouched by the government. In Warsaw they would do something similar at times and put some smaller sets but it doesn't really help or make the city more liveable when it's over 30 degrees outside. Singapore, is different as it's literally invaded by vegetation and the city seems to be actively supporting the continuous transformation of the city towards being even more of a, as they would call it, a garden city. They have a theater which looks like a futuristic sea shell. They have an ArtScience museum which looks like a lotus leaf, although built our of concrete, it does actually have a myriad of lotus leafs around it which also show its beauty midday. They have an amazing, yet another modernist/futuristic helix bridge and others with loads of flowers planted along. Many objects, gorgeously illuminated at night, creating an ambience one of its kind.
</p>

<p>
  At this point I had to start rolling back to the airport, which has proven a bit difficult as I was literally running out of time and I missed my train so I had to make due with a bus. I got in, though. But establishing its route and where I should get off did take a while. On my way back I did find the are quite vacant although still sprawling with amazing, contemporary/futuristic architecture and some of the older, colonial time relicts. The city was very, amazingly clean... And I felt safe there, not as completely as I did while I was in Japan (still my nr. 1) but wow, Singapore was a blast and the wave tore my mind away. I have a few friends who are looking forward to cities recreated in harmony with nature, as if contemporary modern greens. This city has shown me that this vision is actually quite possible, I thought that myself and find it the right way as we don't just want cities, we want liveable cities, the environments shape who we are and how we behave. But there was more in this city which has showcased, that there is much more to it. It's literally a glimpse to the future. If you want to see how it looks like, you gotta visit Singapore. As if a natural utopia, a blend of nature and modern human constructs heading towards the future.
</p>

<p>
  And then? I had to get ready to get going to Athens... and tank a lot of water into myself as the upcoming around 9 hours of flying would make a hit and I needed to survive it.
