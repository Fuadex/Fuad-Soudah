    I woke up today in my bed. As trivial these words might sound, this was a true accomplishment. When you travel, it's good to uncover local customs. The Korean one entails soju and beer. You hit a pub and for a pint, the bartender wants to give you 3 liters. You pay, you get a jug instead. You go to a soju place and people start playing a drinking game. I constantly mess up and end up drinking over 10 shots in just a few minutes. Few hours earlier, culminating dinner, with all you can eat arrangement. Most evacuated my stomach before the night ended. I played pool. I startled some Korean girl. I got knocked out in the Taxi. Which the driver totally understood. And I woke up. And there's nobody.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Welcoming Party</h4></center>
    The use of the flexible KTX ticket was relatively straightforward. I had to print the pass itself, though, which I'm finding ridiculous. Here I'm planning on travelling by a high-speed train and I'm required to print a pass that just really comes down to information about me, some rules and a QR Code? This just feels like bad user experience. In theory I could have just provided a PDF on my smartphone but the requirement is clearly stated on Korail Pass's website, which by the way, is at times quite ambiguous in terms of the rules. I'm starting to understand why do many Koreans, including Professors, do not speak English well, not just particularly mentioning the pronunciation which can be difficult to grasp but the structural form of the language that is just often unpolished, unrefined, vague and at times just wrong. That having said, I popped up at the station, asked for the next train to Seoul and in a few minutes I was on my way to Seoul.<br><br>

    Now, another thing, the KTX itself. South Korea without any doubt, is a beautiful country. And so does the trainline provide a magnificent view covering large distances, often unobstructed by unsatisfactory weather conditions. What is even more compelling is how highrises pop up in clusters out of nowhere, in the middle of fields. This is something to criticise actually but the perspective is certainly, highly distinct. Despite, that the urbanisation takes place chaotically and in my opinion without consideration for the quality of life of the dwellers, the view of hills covered in forests, uniform green fields, seas of concrete poured to connect cities and towns, these are miles of roads and supporting infrastructure with urbanised scape blended into the picture. Such, appearing recurrently and just as gorgeous as before. And I have probably mentioned in one of my previous blogs, that they build the train stations in this country as if they were to blend into the structures some form of stadiums for masses. It's not always the case and it could be an exaggeration but after I have seen a few of these places in Asia, I kind of wonder, exactly how much does it take to raise those accompanied by the railtracks and supporting infrastructure. They're still very raw and it often feels empty inside but they're definitely built to withstand much, keep lots of people within and probably handle a much larger population.<br><br>

    The trains on the other hand is something else. And that is something that prompts me to think about something completely else again indeed. Now when I do travels, I usually tend to associate what I see with other places that I have been to. I make connotations and I feel this is completely natural. Many will travel for a myriad of reasons and experience places in their own ways, each to their own. I prefer taking the analytical approach as I believe, that gaining experience from my travels and taking an analytical approach will benefit in some ways the work that I will conduct in the future. So, in this instance, the KTX train. I would assume there are many different carriages and in fact, these are not bad carriages. But they certainly do have some ways in which those could be improved. I didn't want to make too many remarks but after having travelled three times in trains that were literally the same, I guess I should name what I did indeed see. There is some space for luggage overhead. There are toilets. There is wifi, which gets heavily congested once many people get packed into the train. In some cases, they will make the train longer, that is amount the carriages to... was it around 20, with which I was travelling back to Daejeon? The windows are large enough to enjoy what's outside. And the seats are reasonably comfortable. There are also some TVs installed, which showcase a variety of advertisements and also strange animations. And the trains are also nicely soundproofed. There is some reading material even. And the air conditioning works. But you know what? I'll be here the sad fuck to complain about this train actually.<br><br>

    First of all, there is little legroom. I felt as if I was travelling in an economy, even low-cost flight carrier. It's also not that easy to use your laptop, as the sliding table provided is just not large enough. There are also no power plugs which, personally, it seems a huge oversight. I know that some trains in Europe and many all in all do not provide you the option to charge our electronic devices. But you would expect such a service in a high speed train, especially considering what the customers are being charged for the travel. Also, I know trains are supposed to take your from point A to B. But I have travelled with a variety of configurations and frankly, the interior design could have been done better. This is actually a criticism that I have to public transport in this country as a whole. Sure, you have T-Money card with which you can pay literally anywhere in Korea for a variety of services, also the public transport ones. But if you need to pay for a ticket, the system is that you throw your banknote into a box and you receive your change manually by the driver. The fleet is substandard and although it could be argued that it is reasonably cheap, you'll get a hellovabetter service in... Australia even. But I'm comparing this to other countries too, such as Germany - it's better. Can't compete with the modern fleet that you can come across in Poland, though, where wifi onboard, disable accessible fleet, LCD screens, ample room and comfy seats are available for less than what Korea charges for. That at least partially extends to train fleet, which is just more comfortable in many other countries. Which prompts me to ask as to why should other countries not try going ahead with high-speed solutions? Seems like it's just the infrastructure, which will require immense amounts of resources invested. But they do now too.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Living</h4></center>
    So that's that and it's time for the campus itself okay? Well, the campus itself is garganteous and as I mentioned in my previous blog, it ain't easy to get here just simply by taking one bus. And even once you do that you'll have plenty of walking distance to your place. I know what I'm... Okay, let's just say I got lost while reaching the campus and the dormitory I reached was... well underwhelming to treat it mildly. Before reaching it, I passed quite a few buildings the names of which were quite interesting as many of the builings here at KAIST are somewhat as if Institutes, with very specialised fields that are accompanied by such as intricate names. I would write them down here, but on google maps there are all Korean equivalents showcased. And the Korean google maps also sucks as it provides with low-quality maps for some reason. Well hey, it's not the first time that this giant sucks, so. But I would not be surprised if I found a place jak advanced institute for deep 3D laser imaging or something in this formula. All of which, naturally, backed up by real cutting-edge research. And in this particular regards I have no doubts about this university as it really does have a quite impressive research/productive output. I'll get back to that once I revisit KAIST's gallery.<br><br>

    So, the dormitory. Well, it is a dormitory. KAIST's campus is, well, quite old actually. Frankly, the city, as mentioned in the previous blog, feels not quite like the dreamy images of a high-tech country. It's just disjointed. The dormitory itself contains 3 people in a room. It has shared facilities such as showers, toilets, a common room... So, I literally went for a vacation but instead - this is an actual university and one experience that I have not been in touch with for years actually. My brain can't process that much atm so I guess I'm feeling fine with it. Even if the room contains a one bunk and a regular beds, a jointed drawer and three desks with a bit of space to do your studying with extra drawers and space for your stuff. These rooms are not quite small, I guess if it was stripped away of all the furniture, it'd be like 2.5m x 6m, so roughly 15 square meters is not bad but privacy is something that I'm really used to. In terms of the furniture quality... Well, it's sufficient. And it has AC which is a large plus, except that its performance is debatable, it is also a bit loud and with my flatmates, in theory it could be something debatable but.. they're very level-headed people. So far there are absolutely no issues, communication is fine, although they're a bit excruciatingly quiet. I wish we were emailed who we'd be living with in advance. I'll come later on to the social life here but let me just point out, that the only really positive thing about the dormitory is... the chair. Or the rolling armchairs that everyone has at their disposal. High quality, very comfortable and you could work for hours. Actually now that I think about it, the common room is also refubrished and very comfortable to spend time in. But that's where the positives end. I still have no idea how the washing machines work as the instructions are in Korean. And yet again, the signs around the campus are at times in broken English... I mean, not just the dormitory itself but outside of it, on campus... I still don't get it.<br><br>

    I could also mention some details, like the tap has to be lowered for the water to flow. That there are mosquitoes in this country. That the door locks in the dormitory are a joke. That the security guy speaks broken English. And that I have severe doubts about the hygiene of some parts of this place. Considering my blood test results have shown a decreased amount of white cells, I just hope these kicked in upon my arrival here, as falling sick is something I'm not looking for. But hey, my travels were quite intense, if these didn't break me, what could then? Let's move up. The campus is, yet again, quite huge. It takes around 20 minutes from my dorm to reach the southern gate. I might have a skewed perception, as I feel the campus is larger than of this I experienced at University of Sydney or similar campuses at this city. It's just how humongous it is, how monumentally built, how the streets within the campus are really wide (two lane streets with a split pedestrian-cycle pathways placed on each side), with a great share of green spaces and a variety of building blocks that rise up in the middle of nowhere. Most of which... actually remind me of sociorealism. I hope I won't get banned for this in this country, considering that apparently they do monitor the internet, paradoxically. But I used to live near a town called Piaseczno and this city reminds me with its housing blocks for what I have seen back in Poland. With its negative aspects, that is bland sociorealism architecture, just twins cloned without any vision preceding the city planning phase. KAIST campus still looks a bit better compared to what I saw outside of it, while I'm unsure of as to whether European or Australian style housing would be appropriate for this country, if you're pushing for highly urbanised spaces, I guess you ought to foresee the consequences which come with one-track-minded housing construction. Which severely impacts the environment as I believe, the quality of life. But maybe I'm here at a wrong, still, a bit of diversity and visionary architecture would have definitely benefitted this city and campus altogether, which still is not bad. But even University of Sydney introduced a series of heavy investments into its own campus infrastructure and I see how good the facilities a University may offer and how a pleasant environment can benefit its students within their learning process.<br><br>

    That having said, this campus does have plenty to offer. You may buy a bicycle for 50000 KRW and sell it for 10000 KRW after you leave which I'm seriously considering. There are sports facilities, such as a swimming pool, a gym, football pitches, a tennis court (I believe) and space for table tennis. A large sports hall that apparently doesn't get used too often. The campus also has a few different parks and when I mean park, I mean densely populated green areas. This is highly uncommon from my experience and a very positive addition to the campus infrastructure. The city itself is contained, as it may seem, in a larger valley so the views in the middle of the city, pierced by a smaller scale river already is closing in to being breathtaking but there always should be places where you can chill, preferably nearby and there ain't a better way for that than having pleasant, green areas. In addition, there are more, now regular parks or green squares with water fountains and some wildlife such as geese and a fair abundance of flowers. It's wonderful to spend time in such spaces.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Convenience</h4></center>
    Now, if you're hungry, you may visit some of the convenience stores nearby. Or go to cafeterias. Or go to bars. This campus has quite a fair share of amenities. There are cafes where you can buy... well, coffee or tea. There are 'restaurants', where you can by Korean food. A fair share is placed in a cafeteria that is right outside the dormitory. And it also has, well, a canteen that serves a variety of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'll get back to this one soon. There are burger places and apparently bars where they offer beer, yep on campus. And weirdly enough many shops are closed on... Saturday.<br><br>

    There is a hairdresses. There is a general appliance store. Literally most of what you may need is on site so you just need to make the effort to drop by here and there.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Food</h4></center>
    Now, food. That is one of the positives in terms of KAIST, although I was receiving some reserved opinions in regards to it. After my exceedingly pleasant experience in Japan, although with some exceptions, I looked forward towards what I would be served here in Korea. A bit spoiled by ideas of healthy food and some experience I already had from eating overseas, well... canteen's offer did actually come across as quite pleasantly surprising. Not all of the food seems great but all reach a certain level of decency and some actually taste quite great! What interests me more, though, is its health benefits. And now, I gotta say that my first days were spent crazily. On one hand, the cafeteria offers a range of foods served for breakfast (8:00-9:30), lunch (11:30-13:30) and dinner (17:30-19:30). The undergraduate cafeteria at least operates in these hours so its fits quite well with the summer school's schedule (9:00-12:00, 14:00-17:00). The options are varied and entail fixed dishes (~4000-5000 KRW) or a selection of sides that are differentiated in terms of their size. My first days spent here were crazy, as I just packed literally everything that there was and now I'm... wondering, whether despite imposing an extreme physical strain throughout my travels, I didn't by any chance gain on any weight that I so eagerly tried losing?<br><br>

    In any case, the food selection is quite interesting. Primarily id's say it consists of meat, especially pork and chicken. Fish are served quite frequently, although frankly I have literally no idea how to eat this with a pair of sticks. At this point, eating rice with sticks is easier than fish with bones. So, chicken teriyaki, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken chicken, chicken with soy sauce, breadcrumbs coated chicken... chicken chicken chicken, they have no shame but be game, I actually praise this system where proteins take over the reins. Especially that I haven't been eating enough of this and I gotta convalescence after last semester. Then there are the veggies, which usually entail bean sprouts and... kimchi. Always kimchi. Kimchi kimchi kimchi. Even when there's always chicken, there can't be enough of kimchi, although I'm a bit underwhelmed by its quality (serious). There are also other salads available and potatoes, especially breadcrumbs coated (?) and fried are something that can be seen around. The deserts usually consist of a fruit salad or... actually, I haven't seen many deserts around, probably for the best then? However, if you need a drink, you can get a flavored milk... wait, they drink milk in this country? :O<br><br>

    I thought in Asian countries, as actually in most of the world, people are rather lactose intolerant. But, well, there there is, strawberry flavored milk, chocolate flavored milk, milk with coffee etc. And that costs as much as chicken. I think I forgot to mention some of the prices, so: usually a set of sides that I acquire without the drinks amounts to around ~4000-5000 KRW. The set dishes can go up to ~4000-5000 KRW as well but as I'm a person who loves the concept of a "swedish table" and basically having the freedom to choose the foods you're interested in, so I usually pack the sides in. Sometimes there will be a bowl or rice or a bowl of fried rice with some additional stuff (I would love to be more precise, the photos ought to give an idea of what's included). Kimchi always goes for 300 KRW. Chicken sides come at ~600-900 KRW with larger ones topping at between ~1000-1700 KRW, depends on what it actually entail, either just chicken or a mix with salad. Fish come around between ~1200-1700 KRW. How much does the KRW actually amount? Well... 5000 KRW is around 6 AU$. So it's decent and cheap. Significantly cheaper compared to what's offered in Sydney. Very comparable to what you get in Munich (~4-5 Euro dishes). The flexibility comes somewhere at the middle. And I'm still yet to explore other options, ie. fixed dishes offered outside on the campus. I'm still also going to say the food served is of very decent quality and you can pay by cash or card, with me preferring the cash option.<br><br>

    I haven't really explored other options, so you'll need to be paitient for that blog. But all in all the social life is a bit disappointing so we'll see how it will evolve, if it will altogether. I'm still yet to explore the city more thoroughly and I will likely have to wait until the field trip takes place and the weather settles down, as apparently I went in during the Monsoon season. So yeah, I'm screwed. There's a national park west from here and some sort of a river area east. There are plenty of cities to visit around but I'll likely have to wait until I finish one of my units and survive the mid-term exams. So one more thing that I could mention is the supermarkets. This country has costco. And E-Market which is like costco. What costco is, is something that even I did not quite was aware of. A warehouse where you can buy bulk items. I bought 0.55 kg of blueberries for 10000 KRW and 0.9 kg of cherries for 12000 KRW. Well what? Berries are expensive in Australia and I was craving those badly... On the other hand there is the Homeplus. And that is an interesting topic to showcase.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Shop 'till you Drop</h4></center>
    Okay mate. Homeplus. I was told there are two supermarkets down from KAIST campus and that it takes quite a while to get there so I should take... a taxi to reach it. That's right folks, people at KAIST use taxis to go places! And I'm not joking, you can even use your T-money card to pay for the journey, which apparently is quite cheap, especially if you travel in groups. In fact, I was told that Uber is more expensive than taxis (!!!). So if you travel in groups, the fee comes down to around 1000 KRW, ain't hefty at all so the convenience probably in combination beats all the other options. There are many cycle paths, which are especially well developed along the riversides. But all the pedestrians... don't give a few flying green teas about this, so they just wander through those and, in theory, I don't blame them, as it seems that cyclists were prioritised here. Still, in general I am seeing that propriety, at least in the city, is quite quite mixed. And again, I will have to foreset a distinction between Korea and Japan, with the latter turning out as, well, turbo pleasant. I will showase Japan in one of the later blogs as it is really one topic that just shifted how I imagined this country and which exceeded in expectations in a myriad of ways, making it one of the countries that I could potentially be looking forward to even living in. But yeah, here in Korea, in theory everything is very well organised. But in practice, it... just works.<br><br>

    Not quite as intended that is. The cars won't stop till you pass the street. People won't hold the door for you if you follow them. People won't line up to access a train. Pedestrians use cycle paths. I mean, all these are just small things and being pleasant to others is somewhat encoded actually into this culture from what I know but, well... Okay, Homeplus! So that's an interesting venue. See, when I say a supermarket I mean a place like, Woolworths or Coles in Australia, which are probably one of the largest supermarkets you'll likely come across. In Germany, some equivalents could be counted as Tangelmann, maybe Edeka and partially even Lidl nowadays. In Poland, we have probably shops like Biedronka, also Lidl, Tesco... there are many more but these are the supermarket-sized places, in general, okay? Now, in Korea the supermarket I went to, called Homeplus was... a hypermarket, which reminded me of such that I came across in... Poland, exclusively. Now, in order to imagine this more vividly, take a regular supermarket and blow it out of propotion by twice or three times in size. Chuck in everything that you may ever need to buy with some selection and... voila, this is were you can buy bread, sweets and meat but also a microwave, bicycle and a smartphone if you really feel like it's a good idea. Now the one in Korea is... huge and it actually primarily features... hardware. Like 2/3 of the store is hardware and 1/3 is actual food. In Poland, I'd argue it's usually 50/50 or 2/3 food, 1/3 hardware. In Poland, you have Auchan, Carrefour, even Kaufland to some extent and there may be more that are somewhere at the back of my head. I'm still surprised that these shops in Poland still withstand the fierce competition and it literally did get extremely crowded in recent years. But that's for another blog. Here on the other hand, Homeplus does get crowded too and it seems that it's binded with Tesco. There are many small stalls were they give out tasters. And in case of hardware stalls, there are many advisors recommending their products. It feels more like a hypermarket entailing a variety of traders, who advertise their merchandise - which gives an idea of a simple market.<br><br>

    The prices are relatively low, although it is very hard to get a grasp on how much you are actually spending in this country. Literally, adjusting to a new system always takes time and it's just eventually that gets to your head what you're actually eating, how much you are eating and subsequently how much you're spending. Still, many drinks go for 1000 KRW, larger ones for 2000 KRW. In such case I see a distinction between convenience stores and this particular hypermarket, which is not that severe as prices in convenience stores are maybe ~50% higher. It is a distinction but not so severe to make frequent trips to the store placed far away. There are many stalls where they sell food that they make on site, which is nice. What pains me though, is that there is not such a huge variety of foods available in terms of, idk, local sweets for instance. There are many imported products and such that are just sold by giants. I saw European beers, chocolate, biscuits and sweets. Same went for cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, that's actually cool but I was counting on more distinct stuff. And in this terms, the sweets were quite underwhelming and surprisingly low-quality. Perhaps I don't what what to eat then? There was not a large selection of fruits either, which were quite expensive too. What pained me for a bit the most, though, was that certain products were, as if, missing. I could not find any body wash, which is a standard for me, I just don't like using soap bars. In Australia or Europe, there is a large selection of those, in Korea, I hardly could find one. Body lotions on the other hand? Tons available.<br><br>

    There is a large selection of teas and juices/water based on infusions from teas, cocoa and other stuff that I don't quite get the taste. Some of it I began to stop drinking, as was purely sugar. And in case of sweets, I got stuffed with those in Japan and Korea and I think I'll stop as the quality is too varied and these are empty calories after all. Most of it is quite distinct, though. I will provide some more information once I actually try a bit of this and that. Ice cream is relatively expensive and underwhelming surprisingly. Also, convenience stores are usually packed, especially 7/11 which are a God send, since their ATMs do not incur fees on my end (citibank life!).<br><br>

    Still, the way how they compress these venues... amazing but does everything really sell?<br><br>
