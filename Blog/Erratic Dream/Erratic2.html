    <center><h4>Preludium Continuum</h4></center>
    Let's hit it off with an episode from the very middle of my journey. One highly unexpected and yet easily foreseen by any party, whether it would be myself, my dog, my mother or a brother if I had one. I mean the idea of travel is probably already engraved in my head to a certain depth that one could name as a mental illness. But what is mental illness to begin with? I would consider it a specific disfunction that affects one's life in a rather unpleasant way. Could travel constitute as so?<br><br>

    Well, let's picture it from this angle. Before I rushed off on a cheap jetstar plane, I was desolated from a semester in which I put my psychological and physical strengths to such a strain that I truly believe I was this close to getting ultimately derailed and possibly hospitalised: my knees began to strike, my right eye would suddenly stop working great as ever. Especially the latter could be seen by my peers, just a small notification of just how tired I have become, compared to the start of the semester.<br><br>

  </div><br>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Rubic's Cube</h4></center>
    It's just the humongous amount of stress imposed. Without going too much into details, I eventually got burnt out but I also had to carry between 7-10 kilos quite a few times per week, dedicate myself to travels worth 3 hours per day, remain concentrated for long hours during the University times and back home where I would keep on working on the project's scheduled for delivery. Well, I don't know, I just didn't feel like travelling to another University anymore. And there is still a bit of this left but trust me, a change of environments... It really does wonders to a person.<br><br>

    Okay then, let's still remain in the retrospection sphere. First of all, if one could name my travels as spontaneous, this time I really exceeded in the meaning of what spontaneous really is. The only thing that I really had booked, if you could call it booked, was the University, for which I applied cause, well, why the hell not. I've been back to Europe so many times, it's never a bad destination, especially considering the semester I've been through. But why bother others with my scorched brain if I could just get the hell out to a place or an area that I have not yet been? Like... Korea? And there it was, an application lodged, plenty of documents filled up and voila, I got in + a scholarship that went to cover the Summer School's expenses. Coolest cooler I presumed. And... since then, rather radio silence, as I participated somewhat in the next scheduled info-events.<br><br>

   My attention was still directed elsewhere. And it remained as such until the very last days before I really should have, just ought to have at the very least, bought the tickets. I did some research... shit, expensive 1100$ minimum + luggage, no way. There were some clashing dates along the way. Then after some digging... I composed one route and utilised one of my favorite strategies, of wearing myself out to the limit by taking a ridiculous amount of connecting flights. So ridiculous, that at the airports they kept on asking questions as to connecting and return flights but ain't a biggie. I booked one way, through Cairns, Osaka, Fukuoka, Daegu and... yep, over 2 days of getting a bit killed in the process.<br><br>

   Sleep? What sleep? Is that a mystical superpower that makes you more alive or something? Anyway, sleep was scheduled to take place in the airplanes and at airports. That's exactly what happened... to a certain extent. And so the journey went through. And here's the interesting catch. This type of travelling has a peculiar effect on me. As my cognitive and physical abilities usually keep up very well, durable and sturdy as hell but I'm my communication skills hit rock bottom. Although it may be the case that my communication skills are actually quite shit all in all. But despite my state and all the semester struggles and all... I did not quite regain my strength by the time I reached the airport. Or dropped off my luggage. Or even after I came into the aircraft or even after I left it. Oh, wait, was that it actually? In fact, yes, once I saw Cairns, at this moment I actually felt good. Refreshed. Wow, holy guacamole ice cream and soda, freakin new stuff coming before my eyes. Something other than my laptop screen, USyd campus, trains and my static four walls. This was the itch I was waiting for. Finally freedom, finally the ecstatic touch of... holy shit, is it actually hot in here? From bloody freezing 5 degrees it did jump up to 23.<br><br>

    So, Korea. Let's skip the unnecessary parts that I would have to dwell 'till bit more, just so that I could perhaps introduce a few reaaaally fresh perspectives. Did I just say perspectives, as in multiple?<br><br>

    Well, think of it this way. In order to assume whether something is cool or not you gotta know some precedents. And call me uppity but I guess I have quite a few angles to evaluate what I'm seeing here. And that was also my aim and idea, get some more experience, especially in terms of a new, different system.<br><br>

    There is less to evaluate actually than as if I was long-term here but well.<br><br>

  <center><h4>How do I? Mr. Buxton?</h4></center>
    So number 1 problem, how do I get to my uni? You remember when I mentioned that my trip was very spontaneous? Well, I wasn't lying, I only took a glimpse of the airport and had a rough idea of how to arrive at KAIST. Daejeon does not quite have an airport and the closest one is rather expensive. So I chose a city that could be cheapest, so I could see more and potentially spend more on stuff other than flights. Make sense, right?<br><br>


    Yeah, well, so I got off the plane. Did my arrival tickets at a speedy speedy pace, literally finished it off before giving it to a rather decidedely looking woman. Told her I'm studying here, uploaded some pics on Instagram, collected my luggage aaand... wait, what?<br><br>

    Yeeeeaah, so it was more as how do I attain some money over here. You know what I hate? I hate currency exchange offices. These are vultures who take advantage of people who are either too lazy (shame on them!) or not conscious enough of what options exist. Or maybe it's me speaking, a guy with an Australian citibank account, who just does not really have to give af about any domestic bank-incurred fees. I'm not joking, that's the sweet spot bank and I could use it anywhere I pleased. But here in Korea, same how do I... question, as there were literally now ATMs nearby that I could locate really. And I was so glad that my vodafone roaming actually decided to work cause vodafone's map said otherwise. Still, I had like, 15 MB left on it? So I expected that I would not be able to get into any transportation without paying for it, so... I located an ATM.<br><br>

    Turns out, convenience stores are your saviour here. Or at least mine. At least 7/11 is. In Japan, that's where you take your money out and no fees. Here in Korea... well, it's not 7/11 bank anymore. It's Lotte, a company that I saw in Japan and now in Korea, that sells drinks and has... ATMs? Wow. And this ATM was funny, as it didn't work normally like every other. First you gotta select the language (although, it's a buttom among +20 more alike on the screen). Then you gotta select the card operator... And guess what. Citibank was there. No fees for Citi Global, yeeeeeey! Others however, like Mastercard? Not so lucky. And so I withdrew some money and bought an ice cream and some soda. Got the money? Cool.<br><br>

    Now let me tell you, that at this stage I was a bit gravelled. Here I was, in Korea, a country that I so liked seeing from above in the Plane, in which I took so many amazing pictures. And now, down in Daegu, I'm looking at something that looked more like a Hong-Kong stylized in Ghost in the Shell, poorer parts, far from the ideal rising technological, Samsungland tiger I was so often hearing about. Where are the advancements? All I could see is a highly compressed living space and asian semi-chaos. And to get to the train station, you gotta get a taxi or a bus. With the latter out on a main artery (road). Kind of convenient but not quite, I mean this is an airport. So, I got everything I needed and got into the bus. But for some reason the guy would not accept 5000 KRW. Still, he took me in. Later I understood that buses cost like ~1000 and I didn't have any lower than 5000. If I chucked it in, the bus driver would have had to give me 4000 in coins. Not a good idea. Bloody tourists. But still, a pleasant surprise.<br><br>

    From there it was quite rather simple really. I got to the train station. I bought a ticket to Daejeon (~17000 KRW). I packed myself into the train and arrived one station later (under an hour) in Daejeon. And again I had to figure out how to arrive at KAIST. So I walked outside, took a spin at my wonderful google maps, got lost, got back, puchased a T Money card, moved to a bus stop, waited for the bus, packed myself into the bus... Oh no, the card doesn't work? Well, I have to pay by cash then. Sometime later I had to change buses and in order to do so, I had to recharge my T Money card at 7/11. Then afterwards I packed myself into yet another bus, now note that this is already quite late evening around 9 PM. I arrived somewhere outside KAIST... and then moved towards my dormitory. 3% left on my smartphone. Literally no juice left on my laptop or cameras. It took around 15 minutes to get lost and then back on track due to google maps mishup and... yep, I guess I arrived at KAIST. A sliding door was opened for me, I was told some stuff by some security guy in broken English. I received my keys, student card, signed somewhere and got to know my Chinese roommate.<br><br>

    Now, a few notes here. First of all, Daegu looked quite similar to what I experienced in Daejeon during my first hours at each city. Which in total could be summed up as slightly underwhelming. The public transportation seems underinvested, the buses I took were quite old and not even of the quality that I know from Sydney, which is still far from what I know can be achieved, such in European countries, ie. Poland. At the same time, the cost of travelling seems reasonably inexpensive, although I would still place that value above the average. ~1000-1400 may seem hefty, if you're taking connecting routes. The cost of a travel card (T-money) is fixed at 2500. The system doesn't feel that well designed either. I would place an Airport as an important hub from which connecting transportation routes ought to even originate from. However, it is just merely a stop placed quite far outside from the airport area. There may be a few reasons for this but without going much into dwelling, it just doesn't seem well executed. I could not find any information regarding how much will the travel cost. Where should I buy any tickets from. Then again, the high speed train hubs are quite different. I guess that is a standard now, building monumental hubs operating high speed trains. Not a problem to buy a ticket or receive a few simple answers in relation to the route itself in English. The standard of the trains is high, they come frequently. The cost could be seen as high, for a train running just for over an hour, 17000 KRW... well, it's punctual though.<br><br>

    The cities themselves evoked mixed feelings in me. Bit rundown, stuffed. I might be the case that not the entire population managed to hop into the 'super advanced country' wagon and remained as if nothing has changes for centuries. Then again, the cities are quite expansive, covering a plethora of kilometers, therefore travelling by some sort of a vehicle is a must. It seems that both Daegu and Daejeon have metro lines. The first one has two with a third coming up. Daejeon has one. The first city has 2.5 million people living in. The second 1.5 million. I'm a little stunned, though, that nobody has considered leading the lines a bit better, though. I mean, why not connect key parts of the city. In Daegu - International Airport. In Daejeon - KAIST, apparently their best technical university in South Korea. Well, but these were just my struggles. Apparently people at KAIST prefer to use taxis (!).<br><br>
