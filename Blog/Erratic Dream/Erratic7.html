    The interesting thing about unexpected things is that they're unexpected. As much as ridiculously cheap that may sound, it's just as cheap as hearing of how awesome something may be. Constant glorification of a variety of destinations for instance, which usually just does not live up to the words spoken by a selections of parties. At times, it actually does live up to its fame, such as Paris that eventually delivered what it was told to offer and then some. Certain destinations however, remain hidden deep inside our heads, basing off a variety of cultural forms. Japan was this destination after which I did not quite expect much. One that I did not quite thoroughly research. One that I knew in some lengths but could not quite assemble from all the pieces I... well, I actually did have a certain idea of what to expect. But what came across as striking, was how much it was not what I thought it would be. Therefore, it created a name of its own. <br><br>

  </div><br>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>a Ride</h4></center>

    <p>So let's take a closer look at what exactly happened. First of all, I had a selection of ideas that morphed into a more sophisticated and yet solid idea. However upon arrival, all that somewhat went away as it felt inapplicable to the found reality. And instead it created an own form and imposed a highly peculiar outlook. Although, not straightaway.</p>

   <p>Let's get back to the days that I was about to fly out. Actually, lets fast forward that to Sydney airport. Actually, double fast forward to Cairns. As I stepped outside and discovered what does a continent mean and that Sydney is just a tiny and not even a dot, positioned somewhere on the coastline of a greatly grandeous amount of land which we call Australia. Some even go on as to even say it is a continent, despite that this counts Oceania in. But being frank, the land covered by Australia, likely amounts to a great percentage of, well, the term aforespoken itself. That having said, the shock received upon landing was... somewhat striking as from a rather freezing conditions perhaps even below 10 degrees, I suddenly found myself sweating, especially upon discovery that it's over 23 degrees outside. And it wasn't even a full summer or spring but just merely the middle of an Australian winter. That's scary, how does summer look like up there then? Oh, it's 30 nowadays? (I'm writing this particular part in the middle of an Australian summer) Perhaps it's time to move places then?</p>

    <p>Either way, I packed myself back into a plane but before that, I had to provide a clear description of my next moves at the service desk. A bit challenging, as this was one of my amazingly stitched up schedules, as if I had the brains of strength to pull with this but here went the first block: I'm landing in Osaka and the next day I'm flying to Fukuoka. (Okay where next?) Well, next I'm flying to Daegu. (Okay, where next?) Well next I'm riding with a train to Daejeon, where I'll be studying for a month so I had told the attendant and provided proof that, yes, I'll be studying in Korea. You know, usually I don't really have that many problems on my way. I mean, usually I would travel just between Australia and Europe and as Europe is as chill as ever, even when vegemite's hitting the fan, I've had just been about to discover what it means to deal with the Asian systems within the countries of what you would call as, well, very high developed Asian countries. And as I managed to get my ticket in Cairns, soon I was about to embark on a rather 2 day journey with me probably hitting the deck out of emaciation, as this Fukuoka destination foresaw me spending a day and a half and in Osaka, well, the entire night. In Daegu, I would have had to take the train to Daejeon, from where I would be taking a bus taking the exact same amount of time as the train would take for me to move between cities and me in Daejeon, between the station and campus. But even in Daegu, I would need to reach the station from the airport by bus. I think that's a story for another day but let me just say, that having such a complicated schedule can become problematic if you even don't figure out this single detail of how are you going to pay for your bus ticket once outside of Daegu's airport, which became just mine. But I'm here to talk about Osaka, though, right? </p>

    <center><h4>Wait, what?</h4></center>
    
    <p>I swear I've already been writing about this. About my expectations from what I would see in Japan and how I would derive new thoughts based on what I saw and what I've known. But it didn't really come to this, at least that fast. Not fast at all as it turned out as I reached Osaka airport and had to go through a bit of a process. Bit sped up by partially automatized, as I recall, fingerprints taking machine. Then writing intead of my address, the time of my departing flight and then once I was out, figuring out 'so what's next'. Believe me when I say it took me around 2 hours to get the hell out of the airport. And this usually takes place only when I do not research the places that I'm hitting. For instance, here in Osaka. Considering my combination flights were not quite combined, I had to make sure I leave my baggage in a secure place, so here I looked around at a few options and negotiated my way to... storing the baggage for, well, 2 days because apparently once a day ends, another begins and that's what I was only eligible for (although the bag was considered smaller). But before I could do that, I had to find myself an ATM that would eat my debit card, digest it and spew out some cash that I was likely going to need. This took some considerable effort and eventually I managed to find out that literally just two ATM systems work for international cards, 7-eleven and a derivative from the post office. But to find either, was a pain, as I scoured 4 levels to get ahold of this, hidden away 7-eleven ATM. I was happy to see the money but kind of less happy that it kind of depleted my account and so I had to transfer some funds and count on Citibank pulling off and checking the funds in once I'm in Korea. Then, the bag obviously and... buying a ticket to Osaka. Another pain, there were 2 different sets of machines to use of which I could not tell what the main difference was. There was a teller and at some point I found out, that for international people they have this seperate branch, crowded but offering a discounted (was it really?) return ticket to Osaka. They also took cash only. And after a bit of waiting and figuring stuff out, I found myself on the train eventually.</p>

    <p>
      Now, I'll disappoint you by saying, well I don't think it was a bullet train. But considering just how far the airport is and that it's kinda like a seperate island too I think that this train managed to get quite quickly to the... well... I booked the ticket for the wrong, much further station. Still, ~60 km in 50 minutes? This is good and reasonably comfortable ride, although the ticket I had was just for the second class and these carriages are a bit limited, as in from what I recall, there were less second class carriages compared to the first class. And by the way, they call these classes slightly differently too, as in the first one is green or something. The change is not too dramatic, though as I visited it on another instance. There was a map of Kioto. I figured, nah, today just Osaka. There must be stuff in Osaka. And so there was, at least some that I started with a bowl of ramen at the station which turned out to be a rather decent bowl of ramen. Tasty broth, a bit harder noodles... I was surprised to get such a good culinary welcome just at the station, where I expected to have places open still at the time of my arrival. I mean, around 10, doesn't matter the part of the world you are. Everybody's gotta sleep. And so I ventured out into the sleeping Osaka, a version of this city which still managed to compel me, now that I think about it, at a quite ridiculous regard but still, also once I'm recalling it, also to a completely justified regard.
    </p>

    <p>
      After dining at the train station, seeing as every joint is being closed down, probably soon along with the station itself, I decided to take a hike downtown, except just at that moment I realized that this very hike will last probably for the next... 2 hours or so. Osaka is indeed a massive and widespread city, which I could not quite assess from simply taking the train, it was already after sundown after all. During this trip I did however make connotations between some of the anime pieces I have seen and recollected how these stations looked very much alike to what I have seen. But then again, throughout the entire trip, anime or manga references were almost nowhere to be seen. One of my first honest surprises, as I thought culturally this would be very much embedded and ubiquitous. Instead, there were a number of massive urban blocks, highrises for the most of these +50 kilometers ride, lit in the very same manner, with many of the rises looking as if siblings. Not that extremely alike as I have experienced in Korea but still giving a glimpse on the life of this archipelago-over 160 million nation. You could definitely tell there is not as much living space as there is in many of the European countries or Australia. I think space was one of the things I started to notice as a substantial difference, after all in many of the Asian countries there are billions of people living in, for instance China or India. But some of the others have a very high population living in as well, Japan's already mentioned 160 mil, I believe Philipines and Indonesia not that far from that. South Korea was over 60 mil but half of the population lives in the metropolitan area of Seoul. Japan also has very high concentrations, Tokio being one of the largest metropolies in the world but the scape of Japan seems a bit more interesting than this alone. In the end, I had two cheap-flight options: Tokio and Osaka and from the other one, being bit more towards the center of Japan, has an interesting combination of connections. Osaka is a large city, (around 4.5 mil?) but there is Kioto very nearby and other smaller cities as well. Now, while I could compare Osaka to perhaps Warsaw in terms of population, Osaka felt much larger overall, despite its sprawl even. This lead me to question what I'm about to see in this city now.

    <center><h4>Surprise!</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      One of the first issues I had with this city was pretty trivial. Tripadvisor wouldn't give me much information about what I should definitely see. In fact, in terms of any historical sites, landmarks, there was not much to be seen overall. I had to seek advise from a friend of mine, who knows substantially more about this country than myself and then I got to know of a few areas and attained knowledge of apparently amazing cuisine they have here. That's amazing! I figured. Except, I was hovering around during night time, so what may I really experience here? Especially that the few places I was to visit where... at the other, southern part of the city to reach which I had to cover, was it around 10 kilometers? If not more? It did feel a bit off and exclusive at first, with railway area as if vacated with barely a soul walking past, very industrial looking to, well, railway area right? But I eventually started reaching a bit more interesting parts. For instance a railway crossing piercing this part of town in yet another half but in collisional-road level. Kind of something I have also seen in Anime, very much reminding me of that form of Japan. After all, this country has a strong culture revolving around trains, these being diligently on-time, people queueing up in specific lines at predestined train-entry points. You can even buy special, heavily discounted tickets to travel throughout this country and this country's bullet trains are also quite famous. I would discover some more interesting puzzle pieces a bit later this upcoming morning.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a bit difficult to discover some things during night-time. For instance architecture is tricky in low-light conditions, whether taking pictures or just simply sightseeing, something I have experienced while cityscaping in Barcelona over a year ago. But another thing is appreciating the greenery as I expect there is no point in lighting up the area to see any of this. So go figure how much I was surprised to discover, that this supposedly nothing-to-offer industrial city started showing off trees in heavily dense urban areas. Yet another thing I have heard but not kept special attention to, that apparently in many cases construction work around Japan takes under special consideration older trees and vegetation in particular. This is not quite Singapore but still a very good preliminary introduction to this city, which I felt would be sort of lifeless, people depressed and overly preoccupied with work but as I started to discover this city during nighttime, it all became rather... quite the contrary. Like with the anime culture which was nowhere to be seen or at least at very minimal volumes. What started to pop up though and were 7-eleven convenience stores which I started to particularly appreciate during my journey across Japan and Korea, as their ATMs tend to provide no-fee withdrawal service for Citibank customers. But these convenience stores were literally everywhere! And even twice or tripple that: vending machines serving all sorts of beverages, most of which I did not quite know except for international brands but not even those produced by Coca-Cola were all known to me. Now, I need to state here another thing, that seeing those convenience stores and vending machines were very important for yet another reason: there are literally no trash bins in Japan. The only ones I have seen on my way could be found at the convenience stores and next to the vending machines, I believe these were only for recycling. This contrasts very interestingly with the fact that Osaka was incredibly clean. Not just this city in Japan from what I have seen but very understandable, seeing how well organised this country is and the people themselves, who I have found to be extremely pleasant. To some extent event ridiculously pleasant but I guess that is a good thing? And hey, it's not even just limited to the streets being not trashed but actually in parts even maintained by the residents themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me elaborate. That was a bit later after I got bit deeper into the city and crossed the bridge. I have come across lots of vegetation and mini-gardens maintained clearly by the people living in the area. Custom-built benches, flowers, plants in pots. At times from what I recall it kind of obscured pedestrian mobility but it made venturing through the city much more pleasant. Many of the local shops seemed very rich in detail, one selling instruments, the other a cafe. Many different ones that were all inviting in some way along with the streets now that I can tell, I think it's a totally different experience to walk around streets primarily filling your vision with concrete as opposed to one that blends in a wide span of greenery. The urban mix was also quite interesting, with overpasses, highrises and smaller buildings right in the very heart of Osaka. Bit exquisite if I may call it, a mix. Bit deeper along the way, I have discovered some older constructions and... pedestrian crossings which have a very interesting sound combination to differentiate between when it's time to cross and not. Bird chirps. These are the little details that kind of do amaze and underline what I have been saying about the nature being embedded within the construction of this city. In fact, this is the only country in the world that I know to have this, possibly others could have tried to replicate this, perhaps Japan was not the first. I don't know, probably if Japanese were looking at this Gaijin smirking weirdly at a button built purposefully to indicate the will to cross a street, they'd start to develop some distancing opinions but hey, like I said, first time I've seen this and I'd wish it was more popular across the world. So simple and yet so nice and in a way, vibrant to a mind.

    <p>
      I have been following some alley eventually... wait, let's get back a little. Or mix it up. The alley was full of sculptured statues. That's pretty trivial but I kind of liked those being detailed and having benches next or somehow blended. Eventually I would reach a bit more of a market/mall combo, which I have also found earlier and found something very interesting associated with those. Sure, there is a number of stalls, that were rather closed or being closed now but it didn't mean there were no souls around. Quite the contrary and what more, there were many young people venturing the city and being just simply lively. I even came across two Japanese who communicated in fluent English, accent and all being perfect. Whenever I'm travelling throughout different countries I am weary of other people on my path, especially this time due to the hardware I was packing and which I recurrently thought of being a mistake made on my end as I should have packed previous generation hardware. In Fukuoka I was even asked by a Japanese stranger whether I was hungry and I said 'nah'. Probably the guy just wanted to have dinner and talk a bit but at the time I figured he thought I was homeless or something and I wasn't hungry either. A shame, as coming across people and exchanging information always provides another depth to the city you're visiting. Still, as I'm travelling solo, I usually take all the default precautions necessary, these are, standard, even in probably one of the safest countries on Earth, which is Japan. I did however come across some areas which felt a bit shady in one of the tourist destinations but I can't say I felt uneasy, except maybe for this one time when I was about to take a picture of a number of luxury cars stored at a parking lot and a number of Japanese were forming some weird crossed hands gesture, shouting and walking towards me (in Korea I learned this means no) but then I went my own way and was not bothered at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      As previously mentioned, the streets remain still a bit lively at night, despite most of the neons and lights brightening up private enterprises are turned off. People riding bicycles, skateboarding, just hanging out, I think also drinking but can't recall. It all felt really cool, lively and normal. And probably this one tourist destination was the only one that I came across during my stay in Japan that was dirtier. But it also had some particular feel to it, although still not exactly what I expected, as in before midnight it probably looks amazing. Once there are less people around and the lights are off, this becomes a bit more of a shantytown. But as in any, I was getting hungry and figured it's high time to find a decent food spot and as it turned out, there was sushi nearby and leaving Japan without eating sushi is like leaving Australia and not having timtams, leaving Germany and not having a beer etc. Although, frankly that's a bad comparison, as the sushi I had was one of the best experiences a person may have in a life, which wasn't just food but each bite marked an experience. Before consuming those, I had to consult a friend to make sure I am about to eat those the proper way. It was clearly a Japanese joint, hard to convey in any other than just perhaps showcasing this as a crossover between a limited fishmonger's and an old establishment led by a bit older people in an oldfashioned way. I had a few makis with fatter tuna and salmon and a few other bites and rolls. While I could not get my hands on the fattest tuna, as apparently here they have specific classification that go into, well here there were 3 fat-levels, the ones I had were just... melting in my mouth. The tenderness of the fish, combined with the bit peculiar spiciness of the wasabi, saltiness of soy, the rice that I don't really remember much about and the fish... how it just melted away, absolutely incredible quality that just stunned me there and then and let me enjoy every bit of moment I had by consuming the pieces of sushi, each priced individually. The salmon one blew me away in particular, there was also quite a selection of fish to choose from. Hey, if you're ever dropping by Japan, never leave it without having those sushi makis!
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I had to do something with myself. I figured, perhaps another bowl of ramen but I couldn't find the establishment + I was starting to run a bit low on cash. Due to me covering such large areas and interest in local drinks and foods with the addition of very hot and from what I recall quite humid weather, I would splurge on just simple bottles of tea and juices at the vending machines and buy random pastries (?) at 7-eleven. Eating out at the sushi establishment made me squander around over 1500 yen and the ramen was around 1150 as well. Then additional drinks on the way and I probably closed in around 5000 yen, which is already quite a bit of dollars. Japan turns out to be relatively expensive in the end but you do get the bang for the buck. I managed to see how the area transforms at sunrise, from a bit quirky dystopian part to a bit, well, full of concrete but still kind of a cute place. There were still some people hanging out and probably about to get some morning sleep, some trucks cleaning the area and some people rising up about to head to work. I don't quite recall what my next steps were or which direction I eventually headed but I somehow made my way to yet another train station, what would seem as the main Osaka train station. I still had a bit of time so I walked for quite a bit and saw something very interesting indeed. In the end, there are some things in life that a person should just see with their own set of eyes. My eyes kind of struggled at first but then once I realised how humongous this train station was, I started to recall that Japan is one of the economically strongest nations on Earth and railway is probably one of the most advanced as well. But to have such monstruous hubs, as in magnificent, majestic and massive. This complex span across multiple levels and covered an area so huge it took me over 15 minutes to cover the hub in length. With the addition of under- and overpasses and the nearby highrises that somehow just did not manage to overshadow the station itself. Eventually I learned that the Japanese just do it this way and Tokio's station is probably the largest on earth. I don't know how much larger can those complexes get, cause the one in Osaka already made me wonder how much money and concrete was actually poured into the construction of that, as if a statue cementing the industrial progress of Japan.

    <center><h4>Moving On</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      I kind of took the liberty of wandering around and detouring a few times. Once to a direction that I at first did not really want to go but ended up in a particularly pretty and quiet at this time garden. By the way, at such early time, seeing all those alleys and lanes being unused, it felt a bit as if I was being in The Walking Dead show, at least from its first season and the intro it had depicting, some empty strees of some city I don't remember. Still, all stunning but the view fluently shifts between asphalt, concrete towards a combination of glass, green and water. I made my way to one skyscraper, which had also yet another bit more comprehensive garden at its backyard. Now in pure daylight I could see a bit more of how Osaka, from what I have known, a bit of an artificial city built in likely to accommodate the industry here, managed to sustain at least some and by saying some, to quite some great degree some of the natural part and make the artificial quite liveable. On my first encounter, this city made a massive impression on me, especially that I expected something entirely different and seeing also that this city does not have much to offer, apparently, from the cultural side it still had a quite massive bit to impress me with. The new, the cuisine, the people and in some part the culture but probably more associated with how the people just live - themselves. I feel there were more details that I could share but hell, after spending a night in Osaka I think I managed to pour out enough of the details.
    </p>

    <p>
      My very next step was to go back to the station. It was very early in the morning but already there was a grand amount of activity clearly visible in a very structured way also. People commuting to work, perhaps to school too and others. Queuing up, minding their own business, phones. One I got into the train I could see how exactly large this city was and then I wondered, is it really only 4.5 million people living here? Now I was en route to a much smaller place, I thought it would be really really small, as if a village, Fukuoka I mean, first time I ever heard of such city. But hey, even those 'villages' turn out to be sprawling 1.5 million large villages. I mean, in Poland we only have a few of such 'villages' and in Germany many won't even exceed 250 thousand people, in Japan it seems everything quadruples. And to finish this bit off, was there anything that I perhaps could clearly say with clear conscience that I particularly disliked? No. Felt ambivalent about? Yeah, the food sold at 7-eleven. In the end, the food that I was seeing, most of it seemed quite artificial to me. I don't know where the Japanese make their groceries but I guess in terms of food, Australia seems well ahead in terms of quality. There are some interesting connotations to be made and differences that I have perceived on my way through both: Japan and Korea.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I'm at it I could also deliver a short about Fukuoka. A short, as despite I had a day and a half to spend in this city-named Prefecture, I hardly managed to see much and in the end, my impressions came down to average. Sure I've spent most of the night listening to music and ambulate on a swing in a gorgeous park near an even more gorgeous lake from which magnificent hill/mountain ranges could be seen (although not at night) and even turtles swimming and chilling but even during the day I did not get to see as much. On one hand, tripadvisor's mobile app was to blame as it just simply did not showcase much that I could see and as it turned out, there was a fair good bit of culture to be discovered all around the city... but not so much within the city itself. Sure I dropped by a temple or two but then I just also focus on piercing through the city, eating as I believe 2-3 bowls of ramen on that day, a bit disappointed as Osaka had better and Fukuoka was supposed to be the city of ramen, even if I bought one and ate at a private box (just you and your ramen, how intimate) and another one in a superthick broth at a very busily attended local rundown store (but actually that ramen was amazing) with the people running it saying hello (I think?) and goodbye (I think so too? with each customer entering and leaving the premises. I saw a hill nearby overseeing the strait between Japan and Korea. Not so longer after I had a flight which would take me a bit above an hour, from which I could gaze at all the beauty underneath... I did not realize at that time, heck I might have slept for most of this trip but there is something really fascinating about this part of the world. Yes, I actually saw Fukuoka leaving right in front of my eyes and seeing how such a 1.5 million people city and how large, how sprawled and massive it was, I could only comprehend on another day how even larger of a metropoly Osaka was, when I descended not that much a month later. This was also the city in which I was offered food while stealing some wifi from nearby starbucks, a good destination point if you need to charge yo stuff and get connected to the outer world. Usually the only, as maccas does not always offer the charging commodities but hey, there are some facilities coming from the advancement of the globalisation age. Totally good user experience.

    <p>
      One thing that has stricken me at this point was how different the city here was compared to Osaka. Let me explain, whenever I go to certain countries, however far you may roam or not, you would still come across very similar brands, perhaps some or even much more local produce but still there will be specific brands that will be all around. See, Japan is a very well connected country, with a very high population. It would make sense if they had major brands, which they do actually and many export lots of their stuff overseas as well. In fact, Japan has some of the largest conglomerates in the region and potentially in the world as well and in case of electronics, I guess you will find the same stuff all over but in terms of food... I walk into a 7-eleven and I discover that the shelves seems to contain really different things. It might have been just an impression but from what I recall, I definitely ended up walking out the store with a set of very newly seen junk food (kind of tasty nonetheless) and which I would not yet discover at this time but certainly in Kioto, would that the foods served at bars and restaurants be quite different as well. To a very high degree different. I think I was frank, I don't know that much about Japan all in all. But I was fascinated to see so many differences in terms of even the food culture. People seemed different somehow too. Oh and I forgot to tell about the vending machines containing different drinks as well. Even though so connected, so regionalized as well. And I think I will have a bit more to say about this once I start my part about Kioto too.
    </p>

    <p>Thing about not sleeping, it's a bit of a demonising state. Even though you may lapse into those states and now and often, there is so much your body can take but the mental shifts are a bit harder to grasp on. What I tend to see in myself is just how much harder it is to remember the things as they were even as opposed to other sleepless nights, when I actually did get some sleep. It's cool to have a solid documentation made which really helps to recollect details but these go bland and fade away to certain degree, always. Sometimes it's probably even better and easier to forget, especially at the days when a person starts to value and play with emotions as if they were a colour pallete. My route back was quite simple. A bit earlier than that I remember taking a bus and not disembarking properly with my travel card. The bus driver actually came out took my card, scanned it and gave it back to me afterwards. Like I said, the extent to which this nation is polite and pleasant is taken to extremes, something I very much do like in this nation and which I believe to be very unique, so far from what I've seen in the world. At the airport I was happy to see they had international power sockets, something that should be built into such hubs as standard. I was still full from the ramens and other stuff I've eaten. I have also visited a supermarket after hours and felt a bit strange hovering around the streets after dark for some reason. But like I said, this is a very safe country, I would not expect anything to really happen in the end. And yet it felt weird. Perhaps not weirder than a full grown man swinging at a children's playground in the middle of the night. Still it didn't feel safe enough to make myself crash at a bench. Or perhaps I figured I can't do that to such a polite nation. But awaiting sunrise while not sleeping is torture that I subjected myself to. I think I'll need to value my health more over money at some point in life.</p>

    <p>
      Soon after I just left, quite happy to be able to see Japan on my way back for a while, Kioto up next. Which eventually turned out to be an even more of an overwhelmingly positive surprise, just like Osaka but in a very different way. It's so amazingly beautiful, being able to cherish travel destinations on a similarly very high level but of their own distinct ways. It's sad that Fukuoka was a bit of a letdown but even more so that I came unprepared for this trip and didn't really know what I should exactly visit. But this trip already positioned Japan among my ever-favorite countries and after Kioto it hovered right to the top.

    So that's that and it's time for the campus itself okay? Well, the campus itself is garganteous and as I mentioned in my previous blog, it ain't easy to get here just simply by taking one bus. And even once you do that you'll have plenty of walking distance to your place. I know what I'm... Okay, let's just say I got lost while reaching the campus and the dormitory I reached was... well underwhelming to treat it mildly. Before reaching it, I passed quite a few buildings the names of which were quite interesting as many of the builings here at KAIST are somewhat as if Institutes, with very specialised fields that are accompanied by such as intricate names. I would write them down here, but on google maps there are all Korean equivalents showcased. And the Korean google maps also sucks as it provides with low-quality maps for some reason. Well hey, it's not the first time that this giant sucks, so. But I would not be surprised if I found a place jak advanced institute for deep 3D laser imaging or something in this formula. All of which, naturally, backed up by real cutting-edge research. And in this particular regards I have no doubts about this university as it really does have a quite impressive research/productive output. I'll get back to that once I revisit KAIST's gallery.<br><br>

    So, the dormitory. Well, it is a dormitory. KAIST's campus is, well, quite old actually. Frankly, the city, as mentioned in the previous blog, feels not quite like the dreamy images of a high-tech country. It's just disjointed. The dormitory itself contains 3 people in a room. It has shared facilities such as showers, toilets, a common room... So, I literally went for a vacation but instead - this is an actual university and one experience that I have not been in touch with for years actually. My brain can't process that much atm so I guess I'm feeling fine with it. Even if the room contains a one bunk and a regular beds, a jointed drawer and three desks with a bit of space to do your studying with extra drawers and space for your stuff. These rooms are not quite small, I guess if it was stripped away of all the furniture, it'd be like 2.5m x 6m, so roughly 15 square meters is not bad but privacy is something that I'm really used to. In terms of the furniture quality... Well, it's sufficient. And it has AC which is a large plus, except that its performance is debatable, it is also a bit loud and with my flatmates, in theory it could be something debatable but.. they're very level-headed people. So far there are absolutely no issues, communication is fine, although they're a bit excruciatingly quiet. I wish we were emailed who we'd be living with in advance. I'll come later on to the social life here but let me just point out, that the only really positive thing about the dormitory is... the chair. Or the rolling armchairs that everyone has at their disposal. High quality, very comfortable and you could work for hours. Actually now that I think about it, the common room is also refubrished and very comfortable to spend time in. But that's where the positives end. I still have no idea how the washing machines work as the instructions are in Korean. And yet again, the signs around the campus are at times in broken English... I mean, not just the dormitory itself but outside of it, on campus... I still don't get it.<br><br>

    I could also mention some details, like the tap has to be lowered for the water to flow. That there are mosquitoes in this country. That the door locks in the dormitory are a joke. That the security guy speaks broken English. And that I have severe doubts about the hygiene of some parts of this place. Considering my blood test results have shown a decreased amount of white cells, I just hope these kicked in upon my arrival here, as falling sick is something I'm not looking for. But hey, my travels were quite intense, if these didn't break me, what could then? Let's move up. The campus is, yet again, quite huge. It takes around 20 minutes from my dorm to reach the southern gate. I might have a skewed perception, as I feel the campus is larger than of this I experienced at University of Sydney or similar campuses at this city. It's just how humongous it is, how monumentally built, how the streets within the campus are really wide (two lane streets with a split pedestrian-cycle pathways placed on each side), with a great share of green spaces and a variety of building blocks that rise up in the middle of nowhere. Most of which... actually remind me of sociorealism. I hope I won't get banned for this in this country, considering that apparently they do monitor the internet, paradoxically. But I used to live near a town called Piaseczno and this city reminds me with its housing blocks for what I have seen back in Poland. With its negative aspects, that is bland sociorealism architecture, just twins cloned without any vision preceding the city planning phase. KAIST campus still looks a bit better compared to what I saw outside of it, while I'm unsure of as to whether European or Australian style housing would be appropriate for this country, if you're pushing for highly urbanised spaces, I guess you ought to foresee the consequences which come with one-track-minded housing construction. Which severely impacts the environment as I believe, the quality of life. But maybe I'm here at a wrong, still, a bit of diversity and visionary architecture would have definitely benefitted this city and campus altogether, which still is not bad. But even University of Sydney introduced a series of heavy investments into its own campus infrastructure and I see how good the facilities a University may offer and how a pleasant environment can benefit its students within their learning process.<br><br>

    That having said, this campus does have plenty to offer. You may buy a bicycle for 50000 KRW and sell it for 10000 KRW after you leave which I'm seriously considering. There are sports facilities, such as a swimming pool, a gym, football pitches, a tennis court (I believe) and space for table tennis. A large sports hall that apparently doesn't get used too often. The campus also has a few different parks and when I mean park, I mean densely populated green areas. This is highly uncommon from my experience and a very positive addition to the campus infrastructure. The city itself is contained, as it may seem, in a larger valley so the views in the middle of the city, pierced by a smaller scale river already is closing in to being breathtaking but there always should be places where you can chill, preferably nearby and there ain't a better way for that than having pleasant, green areas. In addition, there are more, now regular parks or green squares with water fountains and some wildlife such as geese and a fair abundance of flowers. It's wonderful to spend time in such spaces.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Convenience</h4></center>
    Now, if you're hungry, you may visit some of the convenience stores nearby. Or go to cafeterias. Or go to bars. This campus has quite a fair share of amenities. There are cafes where you can buy... well, coffee or tea. There are 'restaurants', where you can by Korean food. A fair share is placed in a cafeteria that is right outside the dormitory. And it also has, well, a canteen that serves a variety of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'll get back to this one soon. There are burger places and apparently bars where they offer beer, yep on campus. And weirdly enough many shops are closed on... Saturday.<br><br>

    There is a hairdresses. There is a general appliance store. Literally most of what you may need is on site so you just need to make the effort to drop by here and there.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Food</h4></center>
    Now, food. That is one of the positives in terms of KAIST, although I was receiving some reserved opinions in regards to it. After my exceedingly pleasant experience in Japan, although with some exceptions, I looked forward towards what I would be served here in Korea. A bit spoiled by ideas of healthy food and some experience I already had from eating overseas, well... canteen's offer did actually come across as quite pleasantly surprising. Not all of the food seems great but all reach a certain level of decency and some actually taste quite great! What interests me more, though, is its health benefits. And now, I gotta say that my first days were spent crazily. On one hand, the cafeteria offers a range of foods served for breakfast (8:00-9:30), lunch (11:30-13:30) and dinner (17:30-19:30). The undergraduate cafeteria at least operates in these hours so its fits quite well with the summer school's schedule (9:00-12:00, 14:00-17:00). The options are varied and entail fixed dishes (~4000-5000 KRW) or a selection of sides that are differentiated in terms of their size. My first days spent here were crazy, as I just packed literally everything that there was and now I'm... wondering, whether despite imposing an extreme physical strain throughout my travels, I didn't by any chance gain on any weight that I so eagerly tried losing?<br><br>

    In any case, the food selection is quite interesting. Primarily id's say it consists of meat, especially pork and chicken. Fish are served quite frequently, although frankly I have literally no idea how to eat this with a pair of sticks. At this point, eating rice with sticks is easier than fish with bones. So, chicken teriyaki, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken chicken, chicken with soy sauce, breadcrumbs coated chicken... chicken chicken chicken, they have no shame but be game, I actually praise this system where proteins take over the reins. Especially that I haven't been eating enough of this and I gotta convalescence after last semester. Then there are the veggies, which usually entail bean sprouts and... kimchi. Always kimchi. Kimchi kimchi kimchi. Even when there's always chicken, there can't be enough of kimchi, although I'm a bit underwhelmed by its quality (serious). There are also other salads available and potatoes, especially breadcrumbs coated (?) and fried are something that can be seen around. The deserts usually consist of a fruit salad or... actually, I haven't seen many deserts around, probably for the best then? However, if you need a drink, you can get a flavored milk... wait, they drink milk in this country? :O<br><br>

    I thought in Asian countries, as actually in most of the world, people are rather lactose intolerant. But, well, there there is, strawberry flavored milk, chocolate flavored milk, milk with coffee etc. And that costs as much as chicken. I think I forgot to mention some of the prices, so: usually a set of sides that I acquire without the drinks amounts to around ~4000-5000 KRW. The set dishes can go up to ~4000-5000 KRW as well but as I'm a person who loves the concept of a "swedish table" and basically having the freedom to choose the foods you're interested in, so I usually pack the sides in. Sometimes there will be a bowl or rice or a bowl of fried rice with some additional stuff (I would love to be more precise, the photos ought to give an idea of what's included). Kimchi always goes for 300 KRW. Chicken sides come at ~600-900 KRW with larger ones topping at between ~1000-1700 KRW, depends on what it actually entail, either just chicken or a mix with salad. Fish come around between ~1200-1700 KRW. How much does the KRW actually amount? Well... 5000 KRW is around 6 AU$. So it's decent and cheap. Significantly cheaper compared to what's offered in Sydney. Very comparable to what you get in Munich (~4-5 Euro dishes). The flexibility comes somewhere at the middle. And I'm still yet to explore other options, ie. fixed dishes offered outside on the campus. I'm still also going to say the food served is of very decent quality and you can pay by cash or card, with me preferring the cash option.<br><br>

    I haven't really explored other options, so you'll need to be paitient for that blog. But all in all the social life is a bit disappointing so we'll see how it will evolve, if it will altogether. I'm still yet to explore the city more thoroughly and I will likely have to wait until the field trip takes place and the weather settles down, as apparently I went in during the Monsoon season. So yeah, I'm screwed. There's a national park west from here and some sort of a river area east. There are plenty of cities to visit around but I'll likely have to wait until I finish one of my units and survive the mid-term exams. So one more thing that I could mention is the supermarkets. This country has costco. And E-Market which is like costco. What costco is, is something that even I did not quite was aware of. A warehouse where you can buy bulk items. I bought 0.55 kg of blueberries for 10000 KRW and 0.9 kg of cherries for 12000 KRW. Well what? Berries are expensive in Australia and I was craving those badly... On the other hand there is the Homeplus. And that is an interesting topic to showcase.<br><br>

    Okay mate. Homeplus. I was told there are two supermarkets down from KAIST campus and that it takes quite a while to get there so I should take... a taxi to reach it. That's right folks, people at KAIST use taxis to go places! And I'm not joking, you can even use your T-money card to pay for the journey, which apparently is quite cheap, especially if you travel in groups. In fact, I was told that Uber is more expensive than taxis (!!!). So if you travel in groups, the fee comes down to around 1000 KRW, ain't hefty at all so the convenience probably in combination beats all the other options. There are many cycle paths, which are especially well developed along the riversides. But all the pedestrians... don't give a few flying green teas about this, so they just wander through those and, in theory, I don't blame them, as it seems that cyclists were prioritised here. Still, in general I am seeing that propriety, at least in the city, is quite quite mixed. And again, I will have to foreset a distinction between Korea and Japan, with the latter turning out as, well, turbo pleasant. I will showase Japan in one of the later blogs as it is really one topic that just shifted how I imagined this country and which exceeded in expectations in a myriad of ways, making it one of the countries that I could potentially be looking forward to even living in. But yeah, here in Korea, in theory everything is very well organised. But in practice, it... just works.<br><br>

    Not quite as intended that is. The cars won't stop till you pass the street. People won't hold the door for you if you follow them. People won't line up to access a train. Pedestrians use cycle paths. I mean, all these are just small things and being pleasant to others is somewhat encoded actually into this culture from what I know but, well... Okay, Homeplus! So that's an interesting venue. See, when I say a supermarket I mean a place like, Woolworths or Coles in Australia, which are probably one of the largest supermarkets you'll likely come across. In Germany, some equivalents could be counted as Tangelmann, maybe Edeka and partially even Lidl nowadays. In Poland, we have probably shops like Biedronka, also Lidl, Tesco... there are many more but these are the supermarket-sized places, in general, okay? Now, in Korea the supermarket I went to, called Homeplus was... a hypermarket, which reminded me of such that I came across in... Poland, exclusively. Now, in order to imagine this more vividly, take a regular supermarket and blow it out of propotion by twice or three times in size. Chuck in everything that you may ever need to buy with some selection and... voila, this is were you can buy bread, sweets and meat but also a microwave, bicycle and a smartphone if you really feel like it's a good idea. Now the one in Korea is... huge and it actually primarily features... hardware. Like 2/3 of the store is hardware and 1/3 is actual food. In Poland, I'd argue it's usually 50/50 or 2/3 food, 1/3 hardware. In Poland, you have Auchan, Carrefour, even Kaufland to some extent and there may be more that are somewhere at the back of my head. I'm still surprised that these shops in Poland still withstand the fierce competition and it literally did get extremely crowded in recent years. But that's for another blog. Here on the other hand, Homeplus does get crowded too and it seems that it's binded with Tesco. There are many small stalls were they give out tasters. And in case of hardware stalls, there are many advisors recommending their products. It feels more like a hypermarket entailing a variety of traders, who advertise their merchandise - which gives an idea of a simple market.<br><br>

    The prices are relatively low, although it is very hard to get a grasp on how much you are actually spending in this country. Literally, adjusting to a new system always takes time and it's just eventually that gets to your head what you're actually eating, how much you are eating and subsequently how much you're spending. Still, many drinks go for 1000 KRW, larger ones for 2000 KRW. In such case I see a distinction between convenience stores and this particular hypermarket, which is not that severe as prices in convenience stores are maybe ~50% higher. It is a distinction but not so severe to make frequent trips to the store placed far away. There are many stalls where they sell food that they make on site, which is nice. What pains me though, is that there is not such a huge variety of foods available in terms of, idk, local sweets for instance. There are many imported products and such that are just sold by giants. I saw European beers, chocolate, biscuits and sweets. Same went for cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, that's actually cool but I was counting on more distinct stuff. And in this terms, the sweets were quite underwhelming and surprisingly low-quality. Perhaps I don't what what to eat then? There was not a large selection of fruits either, which were quite expensive too. What pained me for a bit the most, though, was that certain products were, as if, missing. I could not find any body wash, which is a standard for me, I just don't like using soap bars. In Australia or Europe, there is a large selection of those, in Korea, I hardly could find one. Body lotions on the other hand? Tons available.<br><br>

    There is a large selection of teas and juices/water based on infusions from teas, cocoa and other stuff that I don't quite get the taste. Some of it I began to stop drinking, as was purely sugar. And in case of sweets, I got stuffed with those in Japan and Korea and I think I'll stop as the quality is too varied and these are empty calories after all. Most of it is quite distinct, though. I will provide some more information once I actually try a bit of this and that. Ice cream is relatively expensive and underwhelming surprisingly. Also, convenience stores are usually packed, especially 7/11 which are a God send, since their ATMs do not incur fees on my end (citibank life!).<br><br>

    Still, the way how they compress these venues... amazing but does everything really sell?<br><br>
