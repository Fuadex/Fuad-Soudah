    It's interesting to write a blog when I'm quite indisposed. First of all, I got to get into the Korea customs eventually. At first, a little bit of a Korean BBQ. Now, this Blog will be relatively straightforward, however... Yeah. The situation is as further: I woke up around 10 minutes before departure. I was not quite notified by my flatmates. Maybe I was too drunk? Maybe they were angry with me in specific aspects? I could not tell. The only thing that took place, was me: trying to figure out what the fuck is happening within 5 minutes and then packing a few things into my backpack, which technically speaking was already packed, however... Most of the stuff was not quite charged, like my phone for instance, which took record of quite some interesting stuff taking place. So, how should I put it. I went out with people I did not quite know, got back home, I'm not sure how... Got to bed, not quite sure how... But I do recall having fun and recording stuff that was insane even from western point of view. After an extremely juicy BBQ in which it was all you could eat, we went into a westernised bar... in which the bartender was American. and it was...<br><br>

    So not quite the 4th but nevertheless the bartender was extremely entertaining. So that was the first time that I actually got to know a little bit about the city I was living in. A little bit about the food customs in this country, especially the apparently famous (I did not quite know!) Korean BBQ. Which was one of the juiciest experience that I ever really had. Which might sound interesting enough, but still, the way the food just literally, let's say marshmellowed in our mouth and that is meat that we are speaking about, wellll...<br><br>

    Now I'm in a bus, trying to figure out what I'm doing, what's my life, where I'm going. I'd love to sleep more but hell I did come at 4 am and now I'm in a bus and I know better that spending time in a bus equates to just chillin' rather then really sleepin'. Which is still fun buuuuutt. Anyhow. <br><br>

    <!-- So that's that and it's time for the campus itself okay? Well, the campus itself is garganteous and as I mentioned in my previous blog, it ain't easy to get here just simply by taking one bus. And even once you do that you'll have plenty of walking distance to your place. I know what I'm... Okay, let's just say I got lost while reaching the campus and the dormitory I reached was... well underwhelming to treat it mildly. Before reaching it, I passed quite a few buildings the names of which were quite interesting as many of the builings here at KAIST are somewhat as if Institutes, with very specialised fields that are accompanied by such as intricate names. I would write them down here, but on google maps there are all Korean equivalents showcased. And the Korean google maps also sucks as it provides with low-quality maps for some reason. Well hey, it's not the first time that this giant sucks, so. But I would not be surprised if I found a place jak advanced institute for deep 3D laser imaging or something in this formula. All of which, naturally, backed up by real cutting-edge research. And in this particular regards I have no doubts about this university as it really does have a quite impressive research/productive output. I'll get back to that once I revisit KAIST's gallery.<br><br>

    So, the dormitory. Well, it is a dormitory. KAIST's campus is, well, quite old actually. Frankly, the city, as mentioned in the previous blog, feels not quite like the dreamy images of a high-tech country. It's just disjointed. The dormitory itself contains 3 people in a room. It has shared facilities such as showers, toilets, a common room... So, I literally went for a vacation but instead - this is an actual university and one experience that I have not been in touch with for years actually. My brain can't process that much atm so I guess I'm feeling fine with it. Even if the room contains a one bunk and a regular beds, a jointed drawer and three desks with a bit of space to do your studying with extra drawers and space for your stuff. These rooms are not quite small, I guess if it was stripped away of all the furniture, it'd be like 2.5m x 6m, so roughly 15 square meters is not bad but privacy is something that I'm really used to. In terms of the furniture quality... Well, it's sufficient. And it has AC which is a large plus, except that its performance is debatable, it is also a bit loud and with my flatmates, in theory it could be something debatable but.. they're very level-headed people. So far there are absolutely no issues, communication is fine, although they're a bit excruciatingly quiet. I wish we were emailed who we'd be living with in advance. I'll come later on to the social life here but let me just point out, that the only really positive thing about the dormitory is... the chair. Or the rolling armchairs that everyone has at their disposal. High quality, very comfortable and you could work for hours. Actually now that I think about it, the common room is also refubrished and very comfortable to spend time in. But that's where the positives end. I still have no idea how the washing machines work as the instructions are in Korean. And yet again, the signs around the campus are at times in broken English... I mean, not just the dormitory itself but outside of it, on campus... I still don't get it.<br><br>

    I could also mention some details, like the tap has to be lowered for the water to flow. That there are mosquitoes in this country. That the door locks in the dormitory are a joke. That the security guy speaks broken English. And that I have severe doubts about the hygiene of some parts of this place. Considering my blood test results have shown a decreased amount of white cells, I just hope these kicked in upon my arrival here, as falling sick is something I'm not looking for. But hey, my travels were quite intense, if these didn't break me, what could then? Let's move up. The campus is, yet again, quite huge. It takes around 20 minutes from my dorm to reach the southern gate. I might have a skewed perception, as I feel the campus is larger than of this I experienced at University of Sydney or similar campuses at this city. It's just how humongous it is, how monumentally built, how the streets within the campus are really wide (two lane streets with a split pedestrian-cycle pathways placed on each side), with a great share of green spaces and a variety of building blocks that rise up in the middle of nowhere. Most of which... actually remind me of sociorealism. I hope I won't get banned for this in this country, considering that apparently they do monitor the internet, paradoxically. But I used to live near a town called Piaseczno and this city reminds me with its housing blocks for what I have seen back in Poland. With its negative aspects, that is bland sociorealism architecture, just twins cloned without any vision preceding the city planning phase. KAIST campus still looks a bit better compared to what I saw outside of it, while I'm unsure of as to whether European or Australian style housing would be appropriate for this country, if you're pushing for highly urbanised spaces, I guess you ought to foresee the consequences which come with one-track-minded housing construction. Which severely impacts the environment as I believe, the quality of life. But maybe I'm here at a wrong, still, a bit of diversity and visionary architecture would have definitely benefitted this city and campus altogether, which still is not bad. But even University of Sydney introduced a series of heavy investments into its own campus infrastructure and I see how good the facilities a University may offer and how a pleasant environment can benefit its students within their learning process.<br><br>

    That having said, this campus does have plenty to offer. You may buy a bicycle for 50000 KRW and sell it for 10000 KRW after you leave which I'm seriously considering. There are sports facilities, such as a swimming pool, a gym, football pitches, a tennis court (I believe) and space for table tennis. A large sports hall that apparently doesn't get used too often. The campus also has a few different parks and when I mean park, I mean densely populated green areas. This is highly uncommon from my experience and a very positive addition to the campus infrastructure. The city itself is contained, as it may seem, in a larger valley so the views in the middle of the city, pierced by a smaller scale river already is closing in to being breathtaking but there always should be places where you can chill, preferably nearby and there ain't a better way for that than having pleasant, green areas. In addition, there are more, now regular parks or green squares with water fountains and some wildlife such as geese and a fair abundance of flowers. It's wonderful to spend time in such spaces.<br><br> -->

    <center><h4>Not Quite</h4></center>
    So last couple of days were filled with quite a heavy load of unexpectedeness. A term, that likely my undergrad program director explores to the verge of existing boundaries and pushing it even further as to make use of it. Let's see. I'm drinking a cup of coffee for 2$ that contains notions of lucreatia, mid-way introduces hints of citrus which eventually blows out into a buequette of liquorice citrus and who knows how it will progress with time. But frankly, the unexpected part was, that I managed to get ahold of a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like a charcoal aka severely burnt BBQ or a cup of dissolved sugarcane. But then as it progressed, as it unraveled and as I discovered in the last few days, that apparently coffee in Korea is considered as black tea and tea itself is not quite as popular, one may begin to wonder of the extent of what exotic really means. On the surface it feels European but deep down, Korea does conceal many secrets.<br><br>

  </div><br>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Excess</h4></center>
    Some that exceed in unexpectedness. Some that may seem as extremely interesting. Reaching a boundary of chaos, after which I'm finally beginning to rather giving in. I just passed a pair of girls who have set up a picnic in the middle of KAIST's campus. I just saw a swarm of dragonflies swirling among the campus' highrise structures. This morning, I woke up due to some noises coming from the corridors of my dormitory. As I got up to inspect, I found out there was a pack of kids, speaking loudly between each other. On my way back from the bathroom, I saw an entire class located outside. And I swear, there are no kids located in our dormitory. All this feels like a dream but at some point you just take a halt and accept or tolerate the reality, not knowing what the actual difference between the two really means.<br><br>

    Do you recall me complaining a bit on how Korea was underwhelming? There is the thing that you really need to get to know locals who will show you around and the very best the environment may offer. I was not aware of what the city might behold and it does indeed seem like the neony Japanese style place that one may see in the movies. We just went out on a field trip, one that was packed and I barely got into, as I woke up 10 minutes before departure. That was due to a night out, which was supposed to contain only dinner. That blew out of propotion into drinks that ended up at 4:30 and me now quite remembering the final parts of us arriving at the dormitory. I was being in the process of waking up for around half an hour. And eventually, regretting the decision to actually reach the field trip. But then really enjoying it to the extent that if I did not go out, I would have missed out on a journey, that just backs up all the words that I have aforementioned, especially in relation to the first paragraph.<br><br>

    Ahhh, the coffee concluded with a swift accent of mint. Hooly fookin shiit, this was MINT! You gotta love this coffee. But also the food culture, It's filled with meat and pickled veggies. That I love to some extent but still, I will praise this. Except for when we were constantly spoiled with all you can eat arrangements. So: Lunch, all you can eat... of everything, salads, meats, fruits, coffee... Ice cream even. Vanilla, melon, green tea and... some herby type that was crumbly and my favorite. Although some have laughed me off for getting this one but frankly, the taste was fairly distinct and yet quite tasty. I did my best to get a bit of everything nevertheless. The arrangement in which you are free to eat anything you're keen is something that left me with a wow-effect and all that for around 15000 KRW, amounts to around 15$. This food was perfect for my near-hangover state and would have left me full till the end of the day. But guess what? We had dinner which was held in the very same arrangement... And then the next day, all you can eat breakfast in a... 4 or 5 star hotel was it? Rather traditional lunch and again all you can eat dinner... Oh and the day before, all you can eat dinner was in a shabu shabu style, so like: all you can eat sushi. All you can eat soup with a plate of raw beef to boil... And the day earlier, Korean BBQ what was so mouthwatering and juicy... for around 19000 KRW but the experience... Today, I'm running only on Green Tea, since I'm still full since these few days of baroque-like abundance.<br><br>

    Let's move forward. Now, ever since I went out, I was behaving like a vegetable. On the daytrip. And on the following day, which I could not fully comprehend as to why I was behaving like a veggie. And still, despite it all, the people were surprisingly and interestingly very friendly. Which makes sense, as it is a summer program and people likely will not attend to such arrangements if they're not willing to participate somewhat in exploring the culture. But the beginning are always 'til bit eerie but once the trip took off. Well. Very pleasant surprise. Something everyone was looking forward to. And I just hope I wasn't behaving too strange the entire time. But hey, hangover right?<br><br>

Most of which... actually remind me of sociorealism. I hope I won't get banned for this in this country, considering that apparently they do monitor the internet, paradoxically. But I used to live near a town called Piaseczno and this city reminds me with its housing blocks for what I have seen back in Poland. With its negative aspects, that is bland sociorealism architecture, just twins cloned without any vision preceding the city planning phase. KAIST campus still looks a bit better compared to what I saw outside of it, while I'm unsure of as to whether European or Australian style housing would be appropriate for this country, if you're pushing for highly urbanised spaces, I guess you ought to foresee the consequences which come with one-track-minded housing construction. Which severely impacts the environment as I believe, the quality of life. But maybe I'm here at a wrong, still, a bit of diversity and visionary architecture would have definitely benefitted this city and campus altogether, which still is not bad. But even University of Sydney introduced a series of heavy investments into its own campus infrastructure and I see how good the facilities a University may offer and how a pleasant environment can benefit its students within their learning process.<br><br>

    That having said, this campus does have plenty to offer. You may buy a bicycle for 50000 KRW and sell it for 10000 KRW after you leave which I'm seriously considering. There are sports facilities, such as a swimming pool, a gym, football pitches, a tennis court (I believe) and space for table tennis. A large sports hall that apparently doesn't get used too often. The campus also has a few different parks and when I mean park, I mean densely populated green areas. This is highly uncommon from my experience and a very positive addition to the campus infrastructure. The city itself is contained, as it may seem, in a larger valley so the views in the middle of the city, pierced by a smaller scale river already is closing in to being breathtaking but there always should be places where you can chill, preferably nearby and there ain't a better way for that than having pleasant, green areas. In addition, there are more, now regular parks or green squares with water fountains and some wildlife such as geese and a fair abundance of flowers. It's wonderful to spend time in such spaces.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Convenience</h4></center>
    Now, if you're hungry, you may visit some of the convenience stores nearby. Or go to cafeterias. Or go to bars. This campus has quite a fair share of amenities. There are cafes where you can buy... well, coffee or tea. There are 'restaurants', where you can by Korean food. A fair share is placed in a cafeteria that is right outside the dormitory. And it also has, well, a canteen that serves a variety of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'll get back to this one soon. There are burger places and apparently bars where they offer beer, yep on campus. And weirdly enough many shops are closed on... Saturday.<br><br>

    There is a hairdresses. There is a general appliance store. Literally most of what you may need is on site so you just need to make the effort to drop by here and there.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Food</h4></center>
    Now, food. That is one of the positives in terms of KAIST, although I was receiving some reserved opinions in regards to it. After my exceedingly pleasant experience in Japan, although with some exceptions, I looked forward towards what I would be served here in Korea. A bit spoiled by ideas of healthy food and some experience I already had from eating overseas, well... canteen's offer did actually come across as quite pleasantly surprising. Not all of the food seems great but all reach a certain level of decency and some actually taste quite great! What interests me more, though, is its health benefits. And now, I gotta say that my first days were spent crazily. On one hand, the cafeteria offers a range of foods served for breakfast (8:00-9:30), lunch (11:30-13:30) and dinner (17:30-19:30). The undergraduate cafeteria at least operates in these hours so its fits quite well with the summer school's schedule (9:00-12:00, 14:00-17:00). The options are varied and entail fixed dishes (~4000-5000 KRW) or a selection of sides that are differentiated in terms of their size. My first days spent here were crazy, as I just packed literally everything that there was and now I'm... wondering, whether despite imposing an extreme physical strain throughout my travels, I didn't by any chance gain on any weight that I so eagerly tried losing?<br><br>

    In any case, the food selection is quite interesting. Primarily id's say it consists of meat, especially pork and chicken. Fish are served quite frequently, although frankly I have literally no idea how to eat this with a pair of sticks. At this point, eating rice with sticks is easier than fish with bones. So, chicken teriyaki, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken chicken, chicken with soy sauce, breadcrumbs coated chicken... chicken chicken chicken, they have no shame but be game, I actually praise this system where proteins take over the reins. Especially that I haven't been eating enough of this and I gotta convalescence after last semester. Then there are the veggies, which usually entail bean sprouts and... kimchi. Always kimchi. Kimchi kimchi kimchi. Even when there's always chicken, there can't be enough of kimchi, although I'm a bit underwhelmed by its quality (serious). There are also other salads available and potatoes, especially breadcrumbs coated (?) and fried are something that can be seen around. The deserts usually consist of a fruit salad or... actually, I haven't seen many deserts around, probably for the best then? However, if you need a drink, you can get a flavored milk... wait, they drink milk in this country? :O<br><br>

    I thought in Asian countries, as actually in most of the world, people are rather lactose intolerant. But, well, there there is, strawberry flavored milk, chocolate flavored milk, milk with coffee etc. And that costs as much as chicken. I think I forgot to mention some of the prices, so: usually a set of sides that I acquire without the drinks amounts to around ~4000-5000 KRW. The set dishes can go up to ~4000-5000 KRW as well but as I'm a person who loves the concept of a "swedish table" and basically having the freedom to choose the foods you're interested in, so I usually pack the sides in. Sometimes there will be a bowl or rice or a bowl of fried rice with some additional stuff (I would love to be more precise, the photos ought to give an idea of what's included). Kimchi always goes for 300 KRW. Chicken sides come at ~600-900 KRW with larger ones topping at between ~1000-1700 KRW, depends on what it actually entail, either just chicken or a mix with salad. Fish come around between ~1200-1700 KRW. How much does the KRW actually amount? Well... 5000 KRW is around 6 AU$. So it's decent and cheap. Significantly cheaper compared to what's offered in Sydney. Very comparable to what you get in Munich (~4-5 Euro dishes). The flexibility comes somewhere at the middle. And I'm still yet to explore other options, ie. fixed dishes offered outside on the campus. I'm still also going to say the food served is of very decent quality and you can pay by cash or card, with me preferring the cash option.<br><br>

    I haven't really explored other options, so you'll need to be paitient for that blog. But all in all the social life is a bit disappointing so we'll see how it will evolve, if it will altogether. I'm still yet to explore the city more thoroughly and I will likely have to wait until the field trip takes place and the weather settles down, as apparently I went in during the Monsoon season. So yeah, I'm screwed. There's a national park west from here and some sort of a river area east. There are plenty of cities to visit around but I'll likely have to wait until I finish one of my units and survive the mid-term exams. So one more thing that I could mention is the supermarkets. This country has costco. And E-Market which is like costco. What costco is, is something that even I did not quite was aware of. A warehouse where you can buy bulk items. I bought 0.55 kg of blueberries for 10000 KRW and 0.9 kg of cherries for 12000 KRW. Well what? Berries are expensive in Australia and I was craving those badly... On the other hand there is the Homeplus. And that is an interesting topic to showcase.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Shop 'till you Drop</h4></center>
    Okay mate. Homeplus. I was told there are two supermarkets down from KAIST campus and that it takes quite a while to get there so I should take... a taxi to reach it. That's right folks, people at KAIST use taxis to go places! And I'm not joking, you can even use your T-money card to pay for the journey, which apparently is quite cheap, especially if you travel in groups. In fact, I was told that Uber is more expensive than taxis (!!!). So if you travel in groups, the fee comes down to around 1000 KRW, ain't hefty at all so the convenience probably in combination beats all the other options. There are many cycle paths, which are especially well developed along the riversides. But all the pedestrians... don't give a few flying green teas about this, so they just wander through those and, in theory, I don't blame them, as it seems that cyclists were prioritised here. Still, in general I am seeing that propriety, at least in the city, is quite quite mixed. And again, I will have to foreset a distinction between Korea and Japan, with the latter turning out as, well, turbo pleasant. I will showase Japan in one of the later blogs as it is really one topic that just shifted how I imagined this country and which exceeded in expectations in a myriad of ways, making it one of the countries that I could potentially be looking forward to even living in. But yeah, here in Korea, in theory everything is very well organised. But in practice, it... just works.<br><br>

    Not quite as intended that is. The cars won't stop till you pass the street. People won't hold the door for you if you follow them. People won't line up to access a train. Pedestrians use cycle paths. I mean, all these are just small things and being pleasant to others is somewhat encoded actually into this culture from what I know but, well... Okay, Homeplus! So that's an interesting venue. See, when I say a supermarket I mean a place like, Woolworths or Coles in Australia, which are probably one of the largest supermarkets you'll likely come across. In Germany, some equivalents could be counted as Tangelmann, maybe Edeka and partially even Lidl nowadays. In Poland, we have probably shops like Biedronka, also Lidl, Tesco... there are many more but these are the supermarket-sized places, in general, okay? Now, in Korea the supermarket I went to, called Homeplus was... a hypermarket, which reminded me of such that I came across in... Poland, exclusively. Now, in order to imagine this more vividly, take a regular supermarket and blow it out of propotion by twice or three times in size. Chuck in everything that you may ever need to buy with some selection and... voila, this is were you can buy bread, sweets and meat but also a microwave, bicycle and a smartphone if you really feel like it's a good idea. Now the one in Korea is... huge and it actually primarily features... hardware. Like 2/3 of the store is hardware and 1/3 is actual food. In Poland, I'd argue it's usually 50/50 or 2/3 food, 1/3 hardware. In Poland, you have Auchan, Carrefour, even Kaufland to some extent and there may be more that are somewhere at the back of my head. I'm still surprised that these shops in Poland still withstand the fierce competition and it literally did get extremely crowded in recent years. But that's for another blog. Here on the other hand, Homeplus does get crowded too and it seems that it's binded with Tesco. There are many small stalls were they give out tasters. And in case of hardware stalls, there are many advisors recommending their products. It feels more like a hypermarket entailing a variety of traders, who advertise their merchandise - which gives an idea of a simple market.<br><br>

    The prices are relatively low, although it is very hard to get a grasp on how much you are actually spending in this country. Literally, adjusting to a new system always takes time and it's just eventually that gets to your head what you're actually eating, how much you are eating and subsequently how much you're spending. Still, many drinks go for 1000 KRW, larger ones for 2000 KRW. In such case I see a distinction between convenience stores and this particular hypermarket, which is not that severe as prices in convenience stores are maybe ~50% higher. It is a distinction but not so severe to make frequent trips to the store placed far away. There are many stalls where they sell food that they make on site, which is nice. What pains me though, is that there is not such a huge variety of foods available in terms of, idk, local sweets for instance. There are many imported products and such that are just sold by giants. I saw European beers, chocolate, biscuits and sweets. Same went for cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, that's actually cool but I was counting on more distinct stuff. And in this terms, the sweets were quite underwhelming and surprisingly low-quality. Perhaps I don't what what to eat then? There was not a large selection of fruits either, which were quite expensive too. What pained me for a bit the most, though, was that certain products were, as if, missing. I could not find any body wash, which is a standard for me, I just don't like using soap bars. In Australia or Europe, there is a large selection of those, in Korea, I hardly could find one. Body lotions on the other hand? Tons available.<br><br>

    There is a large selection of teas and juices/water based on infusions from teas, cocoa and other stuff that I don't quite get the taste. Some of it I began to stop drinking, as was purely sugar. And in case of sweets, I got stuffed with those in Japan and Korea and I think I'll stop as the quality is too varied and these are empty calories after all. Most of it is quite distinct, though. I will provide some more information once I actually try a bit of this and that. Ice cream is relatively expensive and underwhelming surprisingly. Also, convenience stores are usually packed, especially 7/11 which are a God send, since their ATMs do not incur fees on my end (citibank life!).<br><br>

    Still, the way how they compress these venues... amazing but does everything really sell?<br><br>
