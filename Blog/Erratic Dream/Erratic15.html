      This marks my, weeeelll... I wouldn't say how many days, cities and trips I have done in this country. Although there is this something really strange about Germany that, surprisingly, I have not really experienced with any other country. Usually I can associate one with a general weird course of events that I may summarize in one or two sentences, for Germany it would be - uncertain, unexpected, welcome and sad.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's not really a sentence, is it now? Especially that the unexpected usually did turn out in colours, as in very positive outcome in an unexpected form, as for let's take it: Dusseldorf, which I had visited in the past, I didn't really like it at that time but at this particular time of the year? Oh how beautiful it was?

    The number one difference I have noticed literally at a glance was just how the weather decided to present itself in a radically different form. While in Greece it was Sydney, as in a quite nice 15 degrees and over during the day, provided there was no wind whatsoever, in Germany the weather decided to be 8 with the addition of some chilly puffs. It wasn't that bad, considering for most of the day, I was either in transport or the sun did provide some warmth but as the day decided to fade away, I soon was to notice that the temperature would drop down to like -2. This is fine, except for when I was totally unsuited for the weather, which still didn't bother as I was in constant move but as soon I was to discover, I would start falling ill. Like I said, physically I can endure a fair bit, mentally I might remain aback but the third thing, my immune system, which I discovered a while ago to be working at bare minimum. I just didn't expect to all blow me out to the moon eventually with the extra remaining stress of the research project I was concluding.
  </p>

  <p>
    This time I was meeting a friend. This trip was somehow full of these detours, of me meeting people I was looking forward to. Now that I think about it, it's quite amazing having to know people from all around the world. Of course I could know even more but in case of people that I could consider good friends or at least that I would like it be to this way. The reason for me not changing radically much about myself but doing quite radical moves at the same time, is also to filter through people. Seeing who actually does like me as I am and who doesn't, which is entirely fine, I guess some people might be interested in how did this Fuad manage to go through so much and accomplish all that in such a short time-span. But I would also like to see what if people didn't know all that and what if they did but disclosed from the perspective of a very low-level knowledge that I have with very poignant at times but specific feelings associated with all these events and details and me trying to keep a healthy distance from it all. All that considered, I was told quite sometime ago, that my memories and friends will start to fade away the longer I remain away from the country I grew up in. Ever much faster in terms of acquaintances made later in life. But I somehow refuse this and defy to take it all into account and frankly somehow whenever I actually do comeback to Europe, I feel all again... something that I do forget at times and try hard figuring out, if it was all so bad in this continent, then why do I keep coming back... but then, very quickly I realise it all again, I just feel... welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    And it doesn't seem to change that radically wherever I get to actually meet people that I do know. And so here I landed in Dusseldorf and decided I'm going to use my German in interacting with the world. To buy a ticket, to withdraw money from a German bank account that I still am in possession of! And to discover, that I surprisingly... understand a lot of the language that I was hearing. In Greece it was a bit of a funny feeling, as I could not establish literally anything people were communicating between themselves. In Singapore, this is a complete different level but in Germany, the hoch-Deutsch they were using, I mean after all these years and hiatuses I was making and me literally making no effort towards getting again some fluency in this language, for me to still get the main points of conversations I was eavesdropping on, this was a level of satisfaction one gets very rarely. One that I could somewhat compare to rediscovering Dusseldorf, a city that I did not quite enjoy on my first encounter and then finding out that hey, at this time of the year, it's all full-on Autumn and so the trees decide to arm themselves by establishing a full spectrum of yellows. An autumn nothing out of the ordinary but once you throw in a bit of a foggy haze and water sources, the environment becomes one-of-a-kind for shooting pictures and just being in awe of how a city can complete an entire metamorphosis.

    <center><h4>Of Art</h4></center>

  <p>
    It's not just like I've been visiting. It's been a time-off for me, concluding travelling and just enjoying my post-graduation brief but still a bit hectic and full of unexpectedness time. During my time-off, I tend to do some other stuff that I would be doing at a significantly lesser volume when and while I'm supposed to be busy. And I have lots that I planned to get done and then I keep piling even more but also at these times I come to other surprising realisations. For instance, I would have never imagined my old DSLR to feel so surprisingly, as if just merely a toy. Much lighter, really funny ergonomics, still powerful but not to the extent I got used to my with not so recent anymore but still beast of a full-frame, which shoots in any conditions with the shots being able to be subjected to any form of iterations you can think of, pushing the boundaries of reality and what you could to do unprecedented and unparalleled level. Such, that require quite a bit of looking into and reworking, which was not that different with my old, again, surprisingly funny DSLR. Taking beautiful shots during the day, almost impossible to take good shots after sundown and even more challenging to get the post-process right, which I was soon to discover in Poland, when I used it as a professional tool in a working environment. That doesn't mean I would take any less shots, which I know takes ages to pre-select and filter again and then post-process in a matter that would satisfy my uncharted guidelines. And then there's my 360 cam and still my smartphone, which is also quite powerful as you put it into the right tools for you to use. Especially nowadays I'm making sure that's being kept alive, cause as Google Orwell gets to know every single place you visit by giving it your location data, I for a change like to revisit all of my moving patterns. Not exactly precise but enough for me to look back and relive my memories, to much or lesser extent. That's how I for instance got to recollect, that they had singular Christmas market enclaves opened up outside Hauptbahnhof with mulled wine being sold but with the exact right markets not really up for business, just about yet.
</p>

<p>
  One of my regular touring routes through cities include visits to museums. That's actually one of the first suggestions I received from a friend, I'm not sure she realised how big I am on museums as these tend to give a glimpse into the city's, well, side of a culture. In the end it all becomes a bit of the same but still nevertheless it's about finding the better and even if comes worse places turn up on your radar, you can't know for sure what you do like and still, most of the artworks will be original, despite many following specific art styles and guidelines. I arrived at the airport at 12, so I just had merely a few hours to see stuff. So I've done primarily 2 joints. Also ad hoc, funnily enough, the cheapest option to Poland did lead through either Cologne or Dusseldorf. In fact, it shifted quite promptly last minute but at this time of the year, somehow tickets from Greece were just a bit more pricey with the cheaper airline carriers boosting prices well over a 100 AUD one-way. That could have been fine as I saved heaps on my way to Europe and back but I kind of enjoy my way of aggresive student optimisation scheme of saving heaps of travelling, so I can squander left and right on entries to cultural venues, a bit better food and some classics that I recalled in Germany or random stuff. In the end the strategy usually proves right, although it's always a bit of pulling straws and counting on miracles to happen, like with my last-minute booked departure from Cologne and a slight, well, a bit more actually overbaggage, that exceeded the weight and dimensions of my bag. I got through, though. And even on my way back to Greece, I got a delay which resulted in a sweet 250 Euro compensation from the airlines. It wouldn't be an overstatement, that my trip at least in Europe itself in terms of the expenses, managed to equalise in the end. One of the unexpected things.
</p>

<p>
  So I've gone to K21 first. I received a map with what I should see and what I usually do, instead of picking just one, I tend to try seeing everything. I mean, the distances in Germany tend to be really not that large, as most of the stuff being concentrated around the centres and these being quite compact, one can discover surprisingly a lot. I thought Dusseldorf was a bit on an exception to that rule but as I wandered off towards the riverside and then bouncing off to K21/K22, I think a merger of modern art museums, it seemed that I was right on point. Some people have work this time of the year... so I ventured in and around and got quiiiite impressed by what I've seen inside. Also, the pricing seemed just as impressive with a whooping 10 Euros for students (maybe I should've tried getting in for free as an art student? Now that I'm not?) but what literally blew me away was just, how good of a modern art museum this place actually was. It mostly referred to the curation I'd presume but the permanent was not that far in terms of quality from the temporary one, with Klee being showcased. The exorbitant variety and just how fantastic practically every single piece was, to say it's captivating? Well of course it was but the work of colours how they combined and formed with all the abstract form and again, the variety! The collection was astonishing and I've spent more time than I should, after rediscovering which I pushed myself upstairs to see the rest, with a handful of prominent yesterday's contemporary artists and to this point, I got quite satisfied. Especially that I don't see too much of good contemporary art museums nowadays.
</p>

<p>
  Then it's been a bit walking to the academy of fine arts, where I expected to find a museum but it was moved towards the centre. So I moved upwards towards Kunstpalast. In between, I chilled for a moment as my feet were already dying from all the walking I've been doing in the last 2 days. Plus I was starting to feel the biting icey weather, still not too bad but as the sun advanced to hiding over the horizon in the coming hour or two, yes, I've been starting to feel it. Kunstpalast was a bit of a mix of everything. They had amazing cars, they had some I believe it was renaissance art, some new art, abstract art and glass art. I had to pick up my pace as the closing time could have been reaching faster than expected but I managed to blitz through all of it and figure, that it was okay. Plenty of exhibits, nothing mindbending really. Perhaps just this one with TVs set across on the ceiling and yet another set of sofas for you do gaze at all this. Which I did, cause, yeah, my feet. Then it was time for me to move, making a round around and yet across the city towards Hauptbahnhof and taking a bit of pictures in the process. As I was set to meet my friend at the main station, I camped right outside, then again inside to grab a bite and being sad they didn't have my favorite German water and then again outside with one of the favorite fresh juice blends and something that might have contained caffeine. Once we met, we were off towards the city to decide on what bite to get and as I was not in a deciding mindfactor for the entire trip, we just had an oiiiily pizza, oh was there a beer? I think there might have not been a beer. But could have? And, what I forgot was called in German but what it essentially was, a sandwich with Schweinshaxe. Oh and there was beer afterwards by the river and two sandwiches, as the guy serving convinced us we needed two, as some Japanese take five and there was a fine queue outside, so a quite popular joint (and a good sandwich to smash).

    <center><h4>Cologne</h4></center>

<p>
  And now for a city that we headed, from a city where I withdrew money from a wonderful bank branch of regional savings bank that I still have an account in, a little bit unsettled as kind of convinced without a proper ticket is okay but me knowing that was not okay but yolo anyway, to a city about I knew only that my other friend did not quite like due to not feeling safe but as it all turned out to be quite far from, well, the blank I had in my head and a dire need to go to the toilet for quite sometime, which made sense after the food and beers and the really progressively getting colder weather. Oh, I also forgot to mention we headed into Rossmann, where I got another realization, that heck, this chain of pharmaceutical/chemist stores actually is incredibly cheap! 2.5 Euros for a shampoo? With not that much more expensive other products in-store? Is this heaven? A sort where you can get equipped with literally anything for a price lesser than food? I even got myself a few hairbands as I couldn't find this type for a long time. And later in Cologne, I actually was in dire need of going to the toilet eventually, also due to the exponential amount of beers that we chucked at a very local-feeling and from what I heard from tales type of a German pub, although the tales related to a much further down south-east slavic country of Czech Republic (Czechia?). How it worked, was that it was full... of locals. And we barely scrambled, actually a friend scrambled two seats by two other strangers. At first we received two beers in quite small, kind of tallish, apparently typical beers glasses from Cologne and a beer mat on which the number of beers were being noted. And with each next beer downed, another came faster than you'd realize. Apparently at times, they even hand around homemade food. The place had a really locallish vibe, it was a bit hard to talk with the volume produced by all the people inside but, I guess it's just something that pubs are known for. Instead of going in to actually really talk to people, it's rather a place in which it's perfect to get smashed but it was still better than many pubs I've been to. And the beer was fair.
</p>

<p>
  Then there was a bit of walking, I believe Edeka discovering, getting to know a small part of Cologne after dark and then just crashing due to both of us being just plain tired (and me booking a flight the following morning, I think it was the following morning?). There were two things that I had to get done, well maybe three. Getting myself caffeinated, which I did at a venue recommended by a friend where I got myself as I believe a fine Brasilian aeropress and some tiny but delicious pastries. And I was served by I swear, a pair of Germans with an exceptional English accent. That kind of thing brought me to another realization. How am I still on and off with my own English command. It's not that I don't know it. But to be fair, I do get lost in my Polish too. And then don't get me started with my German, with which I still managed to understand an overwhelming lot, all of which I did not quite expect to quite happen. Then, I needed some extra caffeine from the nearby shop and mineral water and afterwards proceed with pushing through with my final deliverable: research journal, which I intended to submit right on time. For this assessment, I actually received 90%, so I was happy. I made sure it was looking good too. The process after all was quite hectic and bumpy. But anyway once I got that finished, I... what did I do afterwards? Did I move towards the city? I think I moved towards the city and also remained in awe of these absolutely stunning ginkgo trees, which at this time of the year, oh my my, how I was surprised to soon discover, that where I was crashing momentarily, turned out to be likely the most gorgeous location in Cologne, hands down, you don't come across such locations too often.
</p>

<p>
  So, I figured, I'm having a bit of a constrained time here in Cologne as well, so gotta get going while I still have the time, to see what needs to be seen around. And so I decided to make the obvious approach of just walking towards the city and bumping about the main tourist attractions as listed on tripadvisor. That proved... somewhat okay. I think I also took a look at wikitravel and got my hands on some sorts of maps. And this way, I was albo to do the city, at least the western bank of the city where most of the attractions seemed to have been located. And I have discovered... well not too much of the really amazing. I've seen a huge church with really high trees around. A bakery, where I wanted to buy a pair of I believe Marzipan sweets but got some others in form of cupcakes instead (my German has its limits I guess...). And then, the point where my jaw dropped, Cologne's Cathedral. Oh my, oh my. The first words that came to my mind: What the Fuck. I guess that's not just me, I hope the guy who made this didn't go to hell for this. The church from the inside does not seem too impressive but the outside's structure is as gothic as it gets. And massive too. Painstakingly detailed. I'd say one of the more impressive cathedrals in Europe, in terms of its exterior outlook and certainly a centrepoint of Cologne, next to which there was the main train station on one end and a cultural complex with a museum and a weird opera hidden and forbidden to tread on at key times on the other. And a long shopping alley on the other side of it all. There is an industrial-era bridge too in the very vicinity. And so I kind of bounced around and... uh! Then I returned back as my battery was dying by taking a few tram stops on the cheapest tram ticket (as I could do it, just 4 stops away) and voila, not so long after, back at exploring Cologne!

<p>
  I don't exactly remember every single detail about what I was doing onwards. Just that I reached the place and soon after my friend reached it too, we were off to the city again. I received an interesting ticket from the friend as I could ride on it anywhere in the nordrhein-westfalen area. And then my google location seems weirdly quiet about my next whereabouts. I think, obviously my phone was out of juice. But as I'm recreating the events in my head, I believe we went by public transport closer to the center, took a stroll and head towards a Jazz Cafe. Yes, that's what happened and the joint was really cool too. The jazz being played was a form of smooth jazz, they would play a set every now and then and get a bit of tips by walking around. Germans were playing the jazz and the area had a very, very cool vibe. Unfortunately, I didn't get my hands on beer and partially due to that but also all of before, I was just tired and on the verge of falling asleep. Not really a good companion at this time, even my research journal killed me, plus I was falling sick and the caffeine I had pumped into my system along with minerals didn't seem to work anymore. And it was getting now really cold... and then what else, what else... ah, my wonderful feet screeching from being constantly flattened for the last few days. I think there might have been even more. And so we left, took a stroll around and I think our next stop was... apart from the river, also... a chocolate market. Oh my, I might have never tasted better chocolate in my life. One pure cacao praline, that was so crumbly and yet so distinct and powerful in its taste that it was mindblowing how good this kind of produce can taste. And you could go around, tasting the flavors coming from all directions, many of them from regional Italian villages from what I established. I also got my hands on... Feuerzangenbowle! A particular form of liquour, strong and in flames when they hand it over, full of spices, mulled wine, strong rum and a sugarcone dropping into the ambrosia. Afterwards, we strolled around a bit and moved on top of a chocolate museum. With a very cool view over the city. Then we started moving back and... dropped by a vintage-looking pub. With vintage philips tvs and vintage menu and vintage everything. This city, just kept on growing on me, as the locations I was being brought to, had an absolute wow-factor through the roof. I think I just got myself a cup of coffee with rum... forgot I had to tip at somepoint. Been really abuzz but still just way too tired to be able to formulate sentences in proper manner. And after trying to discuss about stuff, we went back.
</p>

  Also, I still could not get ahold of how well I was being treated yet again. Taken everywhere, being tried to be subjected to hospitality of the form that I was expected not to pay for anything and kind of covertly and passively fighting back on that. Just how wonderful the area was and Cologne itself... I didn't mention that just yet but it's because I was focusing on the city, rather than its dwellers. I will throw in a few words in the next blog but just how welcoming and friendly all the people here were... It sounds so, generic. But really, just how people seemed friendly, full of life, complete strangers. A far cry from what my other friend had gathered from her stay in Cologne. I was very impressed by just how pleasant this city was, peaceful and full of life hidden away and around. It was also in a way worn down but it had its nice feel to it too. Dusseldorf upon my first encounter marked quite negative results, with me not feeling safe, seeing homeless taking drugs and just not seeing much here really. Then it all turned and during the Fall, it was a real pleasure to walk around to be frank. And in Cologne? As before, no expectations were attached, just curiosity of what I will discover. And I managed to see a great deal, I'd say a bit more than everything really in the scope of this and following days. The architecture had its German feel. The natural part with trees were at times astonishing. It felt like a hip city, a bit in its form Berliny, at least a bit further in the outskirts. But I'll be continuing with more in the following Blog.
