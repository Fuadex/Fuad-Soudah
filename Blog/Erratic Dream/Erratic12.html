    I'm in a train. Somewhere, in the middle of nowhere. Roaming from point A to B. Although, still yet unsure as to which was A and whether there is a B. At the moment, the B is a home, that I have currently in Sydney. Technically, still considered Sydney but quite is it? In the last month, I managed to see quite a bit and unfortunately in the process, spend quite a bit. But it is fairly okay, 'it's all allocated for education', I keep telling myself. Which would be right and people keep telling me, if not now then when? That's a perspective I should have acquired before having made a plethora of trips back to Europe but I guess most what I did, was optimal and what should have been done. Except, I just feel that, there is still somewhat little control over what I actually really do in life.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Back to it, eh?</h4></center>
    So? Australia huh? This land and continent, most of it at least, doesn't quite keep surprising me. I mean, it's still heavily influenced by the British. Cosmopolitan and unique in its own form. The flora presents itself with washed out colours. The fauna just mostly tries to kill you. But that's not the only thing that will in Australia. Apparently drugs are a huge problem here. I guess I don't quite need them, though, ever since life turns out to be quite frequently crazy enough, travels heavily stimulating, there are other ways in how one might chill and in terms of phases, I guess I am one myself.

    So how about I just go vaguely through the places I have visited quite recently, or maybe make a short summary to begin of how I managed in the last couple of weeks?<br><br>

    The entire trip back was crafted in a way, as to which I would be able to get back in time for my research project to kick off, so that I could spend relatively less but still see probably and hellovalikely more. Like I said, if not now then when? And so, the trip included:<br><br>

    - Making my way from KAIST do Daejeon KTX (turned out to be Bus station)<br>
    - From KTX (Bus station) make my way to Daegu (KTX/Bus)<br>
    - From Daegu (KTX/Bus) make my way to Daegu Airport<br>
    - From Daegu fly to Osaka-Kansai<br>
    - Take the train from Osaka-Kansai to Kyoto<br>
    - Take the bus to the Capsule hotel by Bus<br>
    - Explore the shit out of Kyoto<br>
    - Take the metro back to Kyoto station<br>
    - Train from Kyoto to Osaka Kantai Airport<br>
    - Fly from Osaka Kantai to Kuala Lumpur Airport<br>
    - Take a train to the city<br>
    - Explore the shit out of the city<br>
    - Get back to the train station<br>
    - Take the train to Kuala Lumpur airport<br>
    - Fly from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne<br>
    - Take the Bus from Melbourne Airport to the city center<br>
    - Explore the city center (and charge batteries!!!)<br>
    - Explore the city<br>
    - Take somewhat a tram back and walk to the train station<br>
    - Take the train from Melbourne Southen Cross to Campbelltown<br>
    - Get from Campbelltown to Minto<br><br>

    Feels a bit more clear now? There are more details, but basically: Daejeon-Daegu-Osaka-Kyoto-Kuala Lumpur-Melbourne-Sydney, more or less.<br><br>

<p>
  The part you're most likely interested now is what took place after I landed in Kuala Lumpur. A bit of a something unexpected, I didn't even fly over this city originally and yet I was on my way back over here. Not knowing quite what to expect. Malaysia is a bit of a hidden tiger in plain sight. This region accounts for a whoopin' volume of trade, as it still remains the case that shipping, is literally just shipping by physical, massive ships, due to them being just simply the cheapest option to transport goods around the world. And as it turns out, one of the most convenient ways is through Malacca strait, therefore Malaysia. On top of which this country does have oil but the economy seems diversified and yet some more interested contrasts were to be found here. How to depict this... Malaysia at least in theory isn't a very strong economy and yet upon my visit it seemed very advanced in a number of areas and ultimately it became a moderate surprise, a pleasant one to pinch in.
</p>

<p>
  This one was yet another of my overnight excursions. As it's usual for airlines to do lengthy layovers due to, well, I don't know, Kuala Lumpur seemed to be one of these airports that do not really stop working overnight, I know there are some but this hub was located quite far away from the city centre so I don't see why would they just stop. Unless AirAsiaX has some internal policy forbidding from starting late at night, which makes little sense, except if it's the law, making even less sense to adhere to airlines. In any case, I have landed in the evening. I managed to get a glimpse of a nice airport. Once you went out, there was an extensive wing full of eateries and commercial stores. Many of which were being shut down but around 10 hours later back, these would be nicely up and running and busy. Many ATMs around, I found one and withdrew a bit which sustained me for the rest of the day, except for the train ticket which was equal to the amount withdrawn. I also saw a convenience store where I have located a variety of produce, among which Japanese and many of which... Australian. Appropriately more expensive too. It was nice to see that the airport is directly and conveniently connected with the capital by an express train, the journey of which I could not quite record due to already being night but nonetheless, this was a quick and reliable ride kept at high standards I've known from many countries around the world. Obviously, one could ask for more like: 'I wanna powerplugs etc.', well sure but you know, the carriages seemed new and modern so couldn't complain much. The way back had one interesting feature, as it was possible to check-in at the train station for the airport with Malaysia Airlines. From what I know, the central airport being designed now for Poland is planned to have something like this but at full-scope, therefore covering many stations around the country. Here, it certainly was the case for Kuala Lumpur.
</p>

<p>
  Now that I'm mentioning this, in the end not just this end was well designed. From the terminal, to the shopping/mall area of KUL, to the train leading all the way to central railway of Kuala Lumpur and then at the station, a bit of eateries and two adjacent wings: a large shopping mall and a massive hotel combined as if into few different sorts. All connected conveniently by overpasses. I think there might have been additional underground and overground connections but I was also arriving late and despite knowing how weird this city is in terms of its structure I still figured, yeah I'll take a hike. But first, eating something at the mall, which was actually good and then getting lost in the maze of passes. In the end, it seemed as if there was no way to leave the central station by foot, so I somewhat pierced along the labirynth of roads leading to the station, dodging the taxi drivers hailing me and other people leaving the station. Also, maccas seemed surrounded at this time and as a country with a mostly muslim population, the food being sold was... hmm, was there even any beef offered? Actually there was, I might have also ordered later that night a shake with the flavour of this one smelly fruit. Very funny it was, the texture was very thick and the taste, what seemed as - good as long as you didn't inhale, that's when it got weird. I never tried Durian in my life, I think but upon consuming even just merely a shake of sorts, you kind of give up on even thinking to try this later. It's not bad but it was certainly weird, just as much how this maccas did look like after hours but I just had to visit, as I was a bit too tired. In the end my phone deducted I've done 43 km in Kyoto, I should have mentioned this. I could not do the same in Kuala Lumpur... But 23.7 km were recorded. You could say it's hardly possible I've done this but frankly, the distances in these two cities were quite massive and walking an entire day can cover a lot of kilometers. I've gone through this already and not just once... It's just my feet aching and eventually legs or muscles associated giving in due to nonstop effort.

  Kuala Lumpur is a... very interesting city. If you read more details about it and the country I was visiting, you'll find it as a very diverse collective. From what I know, many are multilingual, in the end they have their own language: Malay but there are more that do get mixed in, from outside of the country but also English is official. And from what I interacted with the locals, the level of fluency was very high with the emphasis put on the very British accent. There was no doubt about the colonial past but compared to many of the countries colonised, this here seemed like a country, as one could judge after seeing the capital, as one with quite a momentum. One might even say that not poor and perhaps it's not but certainly the drinks and food here were cheap. They also use polymer banknotes which is nice. Still, I should concentrate here more on the outlook at this is quite impressive I should say.
</p>

<p>
  I have already mentioned the train station and how well all interconnected were. I also mentioned how I had to walk in a bit of an inconvenient way, a bit by road a bit by a footpath that was not entirely complete, requiring taking radical efforts to keep going forward. This city is certainly car-centric, sure you have the public transit but if you want to walk around, well, it's not all very well working for pedestrians. For cars, though? Prepare for a combination of under and overpasses, all rather well planned, although getting a bit weird at times. As a result, I had a bit of a hard time navigating, with just one goal in mind: reaching the Petrona Towers, which every now and then I could see, at times hidden behind other skyscrapers, of which there were quite a few built in this city around and some still being built. I think my cousine mentioned, that a few years ago all these were just being raised, as if it's a very recent thing. Perhaps. It contrasts well with some areas that I've crossed, which perhaps not severely but still rundown. There is something about the local eateries which raised massive doubts in regards to whether I should really attend them or not due to sanitary conditions, also what was being offered did not seem impressive in any sorts. It's just the picture I had and differences seen between like the stores at the airport and deep in the city. It was there.
</p>

<p>
  Walking around however, I have discovered a few things. First, that this capital is extremely mixed culturally. There were massive, detailed mosques but then not that far away you had Christian churches and hindu and taoist temples. The mix was truly remarkably distinct, very surprising and somehow there seemed to be a balance in place and area. Mosques seemed to have an upper hand, though, as some were built in a very beautiful, abundant and strategic locations. Interestingly, around I saw some homeless people and some other shady peddling with stuff. Also very interesting, I thought dealing with drugs in this country is warranted with death penalty? There was a nice area at a confluence, where a massive fog would appear at times with international music, what did I hear playing there... was it... oh was it the soundtrack of some old American westerns? Daum that was a bit of a surprise, a rather uncanny one.

    <center><h4>Well, Here's the thing.</h4></center>

<p>
  Eventually I would reach deeper into the city and reach the towers. Unfortunately, last minute it was still opened and lit. This came as a bit of a surprise as well, as I walked in front of it to take pictures, the guards would start approaching people and ask to leave the area. The towers would start losing the light as well, there were a few tourists around. In fact this area around the twin towers was a bit more upper level, with some trees on my way being equipped with a great amount of fairylights, hotels that I passed on my way. The towers would have a quite vast and impressive lands around them, the lower levels seemed to be a shopping mall and somehow in connection with the World Trade Organization. There were some small fountains too. On the back, there was a lake/pond with a huge park backing it up. Unfortunately, as I dislocated here, I was told by a different guard that the place is shutting down and I should start leaving. I wasn't mad but I also wondered, how exactly do they close such great lands. It is certainly not easy.
</p>

<p>
  I took a slightly different path back that lead through a bit more lively area, which gave me an idea of an Arabic district. I think it actually was one as it couldn't be helped, I just heard Arabic quite often. There was a long street, cluttered with cars, some bars and at certain locations also buskers which gathered significant attention, one band outside of McDonalds was entertaining quite a crowd well after midnight. That was one of the good things about this city, many venues were still open, convenience stores, eateries and bars alike, which stands in contrary to how it is currently in Sydney. Or perhaps it was still early, after midnight or 1 AM. I have explored a notch, looked around, taken pictures and eventually made my way deeper back towards Central although with one thing in mind to go through what would seem a bit more cultural area. There was one market located wide in the open, which sort of reminded me of Amman in some ways.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually changing location to Petaling Street Market, which now was really shut with really as little as a few joints open and... where there whorehouses? In any case, I tried to track down these few touristy spots, which were just tiny, temple-related and one market, which was just closed now. There was more to be said about this area actually I just don't remember the details... in and to some extent there was a bit of a variety here too and the architecture seemed a bit unique. I might showcase this in a better fashion by just attaching appropriate pictures. There was this alley, though, which had all these lanterns and these were actually being lit in a variety of colours transitioning smoothly. Now in this particular place, I could easily say, yeah this is Malaysia. I always like seeing such places, that I could easily and plainly say, yeah this is something that clearly defines the country I am visiting, in its character, outlook and other formulas. This was it. It also had a nice vibe after dark, like I mentioned: almost devoid of people now and so, the half-alive vicinity had some form of striking resonance (I'll exaggerating now) that kind of made me feel that... I should start getting back to the station now.
</p>

<p>
  You know, getting back was a bit easier now, except the uncanny feeling did come and go as some people starred at me. I don't know how it is with security here in that country, I didn't read too much either. Usually I cover lots of land so anyone keeping an eye would easily lose eye of me anyway but after dark, I assume it's a bit of a different thing. I came across a bit more shady areas and some that were clearly just under construction and eventually once I reached the station, it turned out it was closed so I crashed at some table outside and nearby, waited until it opened up, kind of got mad with mosquittos trying to eat me alive, then arrived at the station, crashed somewhere and got reminded not to do that, found the station to be opened and ziu, I'm at the airport, waiting again, discovering it again, looking at where to eat, asking where I could charge my phone and as the nice lady offered to just give her the usb and phone, I went to eat an apparently traditional breakfast with toast and some green sweet spread at a place that apparently is not subject to GST for some reason and a coffee, which was supposed to be also original to Malaysia but all that was original to it was how extremely sweet it was. Then took my phone, thanked for charging it, took some pictures of a rising Malaysian morning and at this outside there would be many many smokers so inhaling a bit of Malaya-smoky air. And then off I was back to my well far but homeland that enabled me to do all this. Funny how it works, in the end me being away is best about all this as I feel so good abroad. It's sort of a love/hate relationship here, sadly, I hope it changes and it seems I will be around for a bit longer and want to remain for longer because just of how much I feel I owe, not just physically but by how much I managed to receive with all this. And so... Melbourne.
