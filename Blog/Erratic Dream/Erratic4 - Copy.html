    I've been a loyal customer to Netflix for quite sometime now. It actually even began while I was overseas, still in Poland as I believe. I manage to track down a cool tool called Proxmate, which was reliable and speedy and as Netflix did not enforce any regional blockade tools, I was free to explore American Netflix as I pleased. I guess all of them knew something was up but ever since their service was limited to just a few countries... well. And I managed to watch some cool stuff! I mean, I don't remember what actually was there but hey, it was a tool for which I was willing to allocate some monies. The same happened with music and the same may happen to video games once my faith gets restored in them. But their service did get wobbly along the years. First, proxy blockade (or whatever they do). Then weird constraints, price hike, a sudden influx of netflix originals, most of which turn out to be quite shit and tokenistic.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Erased Psycho Samurai</h4></center>
    But the thing that pains me the most is the lack of shows and movies that I would be genuinely interested in. Hence, I still pay for this, even when I don't really use it. I know at least one person who might be using it but I personally, just didn't have much. And in fact the only time that I actually looked into watching stuff, was when I travelled, as I suddenly had access to titles that were actually quite interesting. Still, every now and then, things will change, new deals will come into force and some others won't renew. So minimalism vanished from Netflix but in turn, two animes popped up. In fact, three but there was just one that I was highly recommended and which blew my brains out.<br><br>

    And so I complained to a friend that my Netflix looks like shit as he showcased what he had. One Punch Man and a few other titles that I would have loved to start, despite that I ain't got time anymore to waste on TV Shows. Then I showed what I had and he was like... 'Motherfucker, he's got Champloo'. And I was like, 'what the fuck is Champloo?'. He replied 'I'll just same as much, it was created by the guy behind Bebop'. So I was like, fookin' yeee, I liked Bebop. I mean it wasn't perfection in its own form but it had some sort of visionary form attached to it. Very easygoing show with some depth and a very westerny lead action. I mean, in terms of that this type of thing would have been the domain of some pretty solid holywood production teams. But it was Anime. It was dubbed marvelously and yeah, sure it got a bit flakey at times and what especially I disliked, just naiive, but the world created was great and a semi-anthological structure (I know there must be a more precise term but I ain't got one now) actually somehow supported it, as the story behind each character unravelled slowly with how the story progressed. Very well designed and memorable characters, punchy dialogue lines, this show did have what it takes, whether it was more of a standard drama or a comedy, it mixed different stuff very well. And the movie itself may have even exceeded the show, actually.<br><br>

    But all good things come to an end. And old-new have their beginnings. And so Champloo started... off the wrong foot with me. It's just, I heard Spike from Bebop in Champloo and that killed the vibe for me. Then I tried the sub and I was like... nah. Sometime later I made another run and woa, this actually worked. See, Bebop had argueably 4+1 characters, in Champloo there are 3. First thing that comes popping is how the show is actually composed, which may seem crazy, even with the intro: for the opening a hip-hop band got featured and in fact, the themes get mixed in very frequently within the show itself, especially in terms of the first episode. Just how it is remixed, how the soundtrack blends with the story and direction, the storyline even. Then you have these three distinct characters, one could try calling them archetypes but the thing was... they had nothing in common, compared to Bebop. And guess what, all of these clashes worked perfectly well. That + highly brutalised and certainly adulty themes mixed into the world, where older Japanese culture crossovers with the western culture, taking place on a variety of levels. With 2 of our characters, who are designed nearly as superheroes. I hope I didn't shake that up too much?<br><br>

    The thing was, anime usually is just too much. Too extreme or peculiar, I feel that is something that just is when it comes to anime and comics altogether, that's how it lives in its world world via exaggeration. In Champloo, they do that but it's all composed in such a ridiculous but still faithful and even yet gloomy way, I guess the quintessence of grotesque but served in a way, that I have in fact only and I mean it, only seen in western TV Shows or Movies. There is a clear progression, although still somewhat anthological structure. There is a common, imho too far-fetched point by which the show is hooked on, giving a purpose for our characters. At times it gets a bit too much, at times even too repetitive. And at times it suffers from the same thing that I disliked in Bebop, the overly emotional and prolonged moments that do not really pitch much into the story or action. I guess that's just part of the style but, oh boy, the choreography, the scenario, the dubbing, this beautiful clash between cultures and crossover. It watches so well that there is not that much I can say against. It's not genius, once again and it does have some weak points, especially by the end of the show. But hell, despite all of this craziness they still manage to retain integrity and feel which in this particular case is one of a kind.

    <center><h4>Erased Erased</h4></center>
    You know sometimes you just can't keep working 24/7. I know this from my own experience and I know how fast one can get burnt out. It's a work hazard that's not easy to be overcome except for giving it some time and a prosperous environment. In fact, this environment can delay and minimise the effects of being burnt out but usually one will contain oneself so that the work may continue. What happens once you reach a certain point? You gotta chill, well, for a moment at least. I actually did that show relatively long before the real assignment-heat broke in, so I can't say that I was not entirely worth it. I actually got into this particular show as... well... I loved the aesthetics of the cover.<br><br>

    I am bloody serious right now, a cover, of a freakin' anime TV Show, made me watch the TV Show. And I started it and... I stopped watching it halfway through. It was just that bad... Let's see what didn't work. First of all, the dubbing felt bland. I know, in Japan they have, apparently quite severe problems with the youth being depressed and suicidal etc. etc. But that doesn't mean that you gotta introduce the entire scope into a show, contain it severely down to a few characters that seem detatched to the limit. I mean, this is no neon genesis evangelion, in which I actually really liked the execution of the depression, anxiety, social disorder themes. It was unique, it was truthful and it wasn't the main focus. Although, many things can be said about Evangelion after all. Now, Erased started off like a show that did not show what I've wanted to see from the cover. I did like the idea, though, of someone coming back in time to save another person. And this entire thing starts later on, until then though, many weird things start happening which just do not feel well positioned. A bit of supernatural stuff happening, a bit of twists that make no sense, the characters were not built very well or even designed well! The story kept on popping up with weird plot additions that felt forced and the behavior of some characters didn't seem as real.<br><br>

    And then afer sometime I actually got what I wanted. There were the characters arranged interestingly. The Japanese sub also felt better compared to the English one. There suddenly began to be some sort of an interesting character development and the entire story began to unravel relatively well. At times they were pushing it a bit and the story kind of came down to 'whodunit?'. Which I actually got to know eventually, by guessing one character as I made connotations to one particular video game in which the almost exact same themes were featured, but the video game was much much better executed compared to Erased... Which was released earlier and was a manga... did I get a bit too far here?<br><br>

    Okay, it's probably a bit about grandiloquence of the story which just felt over-bloated, far-fetched. But the character design evolved nicely, the aesthetics picked up and some form began being interesting. The narration still sucked. I don't wanna sound big headed but I guess I have watched quite a few productions to see when a title has potential in it and Erased certainly had just that. The butterfly effect is somewhat cliche along with murder stories and ideas such as 'whodunit', along with psychological disorders. But I guess the depth explored behind the idea of travelling back in time and changing its course is still something, that well, is quite difficult to achieve properly in the first place. Secondly, lead it somewhat logically and in coherence ain't a piece of cake. And some of the characters featured, were actually quite interesing but it was still the aesthetics which made quite a feast for me. The opening and closing were also top-class, against aesthetically. And what also made the journey relatively rewarding, was the conclusion of the show. Well chop my dick off if I'm mistakin' in terms of Anime but there are really not many shows that manage to conclude its story well. I mean, with all its characters, the storylines... This one does that very comprehensively and kudos to the guy who really made this thing a reality. I also like recurrent themes and nicely developed tension. That show provides that in moderation. But still overall, that was one semi-detached ride that overall had its potential partially squandered. And I'm saying this despite I love psychological thrillers!

    <center><h4>Psycho Pass?</h4></center>
    Now... That's a difficult one. I actually made on approach probably over a year ago with Psycho Pass and I wondered as to whether I should really pursue it. It started well, I quite liked the first episode's opening and soundtrack but how it evolved mid-way throughout the episode left a bit of a... hm, I wasn't sure whether such a show could hook me up. After having seen Erased, my friend mentioned that he recommends Psycho Pass over the other title. And there were not that many left so why not do it? So I've done it' again from Episode 1. And I again saw what I disliked about it, the world didn't get created as thoroughly as it probably should have been since Episode 1. The only part that was elaborated on was the Psycho Pass idea, which is interesting per say, along with the world depicted. Although, fairly limited. Let's say Minority Report crossovered with... hm... Black Mirror's Nosedive episode? And you chucked both into an action-based police show with the slight alteration, that the weapons work only if the system sees the people being apprehended as dangerous. Now that's quite a twist, isn't it? Wasn't enough for the first episode, though.<br><br>

    Full disclosure, I love dystopias. Perhaps not themselves but the ideas showcased as I believe it requires quite a knack of knowledge to be able to foresee a future in which some things go radically wrong. Such picture will not feel complete if it's executed even at an average level such as the remake of Ghost in the Shell. Whereas the original, despite in my eyes not being such a classic as it's being positioned as, did have a very distinct feel and details that made it very strong atmosphere-wise and even in terms of contents that were quite heavily thought-provoking. Then there are other dystopias that I was in the process of reading: Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, which was a fairly good read with a few very, very strong moments that elevated the book itself. I haven't read Orwells 1984 but I did approach Animal Farm, which I did not finish yet but the writing style, attachment to detail and strong connotations to precedents made it a particularly strong dystopian read. Then there's Huxley, which I felt was overly descriptive with not that many points embedded and the general narration was bland but I'm still in the process of reading it and there are a few amazing quotes. Then there is one more, We that will have to wait a bit longer. All these are not quite the dystopias featured in Psycho Pass but I'm mentioning them, as the show itself very eagerly quotes many Philosophers, poets and writers. Dystopian literature from what I recall was not as present, yet its the precedents and especially the connotations along with links attached to our world which I value very highly and which was present, to a certain extent in Psycho Pass. The subliminal approach was ever tastier, just the details of how the world has changed and shifted after the introduction of the system managing futuristic vision of Japan, or was it an envisioned Neo Tokyo? It felt a bit contained, although still relatively rich which kept me going.<br><br>

    However, the main storyline points where a bit all over the place, at least in terms of the episodes that had the first opening. Its conclusion was certainly mind-boggling and just the clashes introduced were something that made something about it satisfying. I like when a show puts the characters within to a test and the scenario does, at least somewhat match the expectations imposed by the show itself. But many dialogue lines were out of touch and not quite in synchronisation with the depicted characters. Plus the naiivety and too distinct exaggeration, especially of the mentally ill characters. At some point this slightly starts kicking one out of immersion. Also, the closing sequences felt weak. Many of the episodes also felt as if these were taking nowhere but the psychological analysis of events, clearly linked to our contemporary life were very promisingly executed. And all of that, reached very interesting peaks in the second half of the season once the opening shifted to its second version. Now, here I would like to say a few words about specific turning points that sometimes are featured in any medium, that is twists. While I would not quite call that particular occurance a twist, at times even weaker titles have specific sequences embedded that elevate the entire experience to heights that were previously not seen as possible to achieve by such productions. Let's call that a leap of God. Such thing took place for instance in Black Mirror's White Bear episode, which was lead very generically to the point one was willing to skip the episode. But how it concluded, made it one of the strongest in the series. Psycho Pass also did not quite have such moment. But it did have one, which could be considered as a turning point; a bit of a twist, shocker and the peak of depth that the idea of Psycho Pass had to offer, which gets you goosebumps, petrifies you, disgusts, feels so unreal but at the same time, entirely real and what's even more terrifying - definitely likely to take place, even in our current society. The scene executed in this show, as much as it sounds extreme, is something that I'm looking for in shows, exceeding in excellence in a number of ways: simplified harshly portrayed depth of distinct American issues in Childish Gambino's 'This is America', Spec Ops's: The Line emotional deceit engaging its players to psychological weariness, Black Mirror's 'Fifteen Milion Merits' multilayered portrayal of a variety of contemporary society's vices. There may be many more showcased here but in all, there is a variety of elements at play that as they work together, make such a powerful conveyance that makes you just hold up for a minute and really think deeply about what you just experienced. Psycho Pass has such moment. And it takes in from there will the following episodes.<br><br>

    The issue with Psycho Pass, I guess are rather singular issues. Most of the time it remains a contained story that does not exceed most of the time. It's quite coherent but also pathetic at key moments and not entirely logical at other times. The execution is a bit weird at times, something due to more advanced animation techniques that I did not see as nicely befitting the rest of the anime. But in terms of a dystopia, it feels very strong especially that I haven't seen one of that scale, well, except for Blade Runner 2049 which took my mind off for quite a ecstatic ride. But in terms of anime? The first season was certainly a very strong attempt. But the conclusion was lacking. Actually, I forgot to mention that Champloo's conclusion was quite underwhleming too. Anyway, most of the characters are fairly well developed, not all of them are followed, though and there are some parts of the storyline that were left behind. There is some distinction that could be made between the first half and second half of the show, as the latter was kept in surprisingly better quality and it transcended more value overall. It's not a perfect anime but then I don't know one and after all, the only one I gave 10/10 was Neo Tokyo, which was a completely another thing.<br><br>
