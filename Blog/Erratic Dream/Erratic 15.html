      This marks my, weeeelll... I wouldn't say how many days, cities and trips I have done in this country. Although there is this something really strange about Germany that, surprisingly, I have not really experienced with any other country. Usually I can associate one with a general weird course of events that I may summarize in one or two sentences, for Germany it would be - uncertain, unexpected, welcome and sad.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's not really a sentence, is it now? Especially that the unexpected usually did turn out in colours, as in very positive outcome in an unexpected form, as for let's take it: Dusseldorf, which I had visited in the past, I didn't really like it at that time but at this particular time of the year? Oh how beautiful it was?

    The number one difference I have noticed literally at a glance was just how the weather decided to present itself in a radically different form. While in Greece it was Sydney, as in a quite nice 15 degrees and over during the day, provided there was no wind whatsoever, in Germany the weather decided to be 8 with the addition of some chilly puffs. It wasn't that bad, considering for most of the day, I was either in transport or the sun did provide some warmth but as the day decided to fade away, I soon was to notice that the temperature would drop down to like -2. This is fine, except for when I was totally unsuited for the weather, which still didn't bother as I was in constant move but as soon I was to discover, I would start falling ill. Like I said, physically I can endure a fair bit, mentally I might remain aback but the third thing, my immune system, which I discovered a while ago to be working at bare minimum. I just didn't expect to all blow me out to the moon eventually with the extra remaining stress of the research project I was concluding.
  </p>

  <p>
    This time I was meeting a friend. This trip was somehow full of these detours, of me meeting people I was looking forward to. Now that I think about it, it's quite amazing having to know people from all around the world. Of course I could know even more but in case of people that I could consider good friends or at least that I would like it be to this way. The reason for me not changing radically much about myself but doing quite radical moves at the same time, is also to filter through people. Seeing who actually does like me as I am and who doesn't, which is entirely fine, I guess some people might be interested in how did this Fuad manage to go through so much and accomplish all that in such a short time-span. But I would also like to see what if people didn't know all that and what if they did but disclosed from the perspective of a very low-level knowledge that I have with very poignant at times but specific feelings associated with all these events and details and me trying to keep a healthy distance from it all. All that considered, I was told quite sometime ago, that my memories and friends will start to fade away the longer I remain away from the country I grew up in. Ever much faster in terms of acquaintances made later in life. But I somehow refuse this and defy to take it all into account and frankly somehow whenever I actually do comeback to Europe, I feel all again... something that I do forget at times and try hard figuring out, if it was all so bad in this continent, then why do I keep coming back... but then, very quickly I realise it all again, I just feel... welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    And it doesn't seem to change that radically wherever I get to actually meet people that I do know. And so here I landed in Dusseldorf and decided I'm going to use my German in interacting with the world. To buy a ticket, to withdraw money from a German bank account that I still am in possession of! And to discover, that I surprisingly... understand a lot of the language that I was hearing. In Greece it was a bit of a funny feeling, as I could not establish literally anything people were communicating between themselves. In Singapore, this is a complete different level but in Germany, the hoch-Deutsch they were using, I mean after all these years and hiatuses I was making and me literally making no effort towards getting again some fluency in this language, for me to still get the main points of conversations I was eavesdropping on, this was a level of satisfaction one gets very rarely. One that I could somewhat compare to rediscovering Dusseldorf, a city that I did not quite enjoy on my first encounter and then finding out that hey, at this time of the year, it's all full-on Autumn and so the trees decide to arm themselves by establishing a full spectrum of yellows. An autumn nothing out of the ordinary but once you throw in a bit of a foggy haze and water sources, the environment becomes one-of-a-kind for shooting pictures and just being in awe of how a city can complete an entire metamorphosis.
