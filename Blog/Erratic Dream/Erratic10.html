    <p>A month is not that long really. It's kind of funny how time can become magically relativistic, for instance when I'm dieting and get ahold of some carbs on a low-carb diet, it feels as if it's taking forever to get anything done and very substantial effort needs to be undertaken to get it done really properly. It does feel that you're bit in the now though, as you may be hungry or not, present in time some might say. Then when you get stuffed with carbs, it seems as if time flies and rides like a bolid on one of these F1 Grand Prix. Before you know it, the whole thing ends and not just that but a month has passed.</p>

    <p>
      I wouldn't say I was on a diet, in fact far from this, although Korean food that I was eating was fairly low carby. But I had also daily lessons for 9 to 12 and 1 to 4 (at least for some of the time) with the addition of homework which took a fair bit of time, hikes to the cafe which took a bit of time, hanging out, playing soccer and other stuff. And before I knew it I was like, damn, It's almost halfway through already.

      One of the great things about the courses I have been taking, well, primarily what was good about them was that they were actually good. They were in fact very good, both: the understanding startups lead by an ex-Samsung I believe engineer with a majestic background and particularly great teaching schedule, delivery and curriculum. Very informative and quite hands-on as well. Then the Korean A1, with a very expressive teacher, who challenged and demanded the skills to be learned on a daily basis. But many of what we were taught in this crazily hasty tempo we were imposed on, included learning about Korean culture, places to visit. We were asked at times about where would we want to go or where we have been. Once it was my turn to explain how I have visited Busan, Seoul, Jeju, a town next to Daejeon, my teacher was like "WOOOOAOAOAOAOAOAOOOOOooo..." and then obviously what I have seen here and there. I also asked the other time, where should I go and I think I was recommended not just Jeju, that on some other time but Seoraksan, if I love nature. Or something like that, I definitely was looking at different parts of the country. One I did not go to eventually was the south west, where apparently good food is at. A friend of mine, a buddy not of mine but I guess he was okay to adopt me in the end, told me that going towards Seoraksan is actually a better idea. That having said, at first I was supposed to write about Jeju, I think that came actually first and it would be logical to put that first after the Blog on Busan, as that naturally did happen in order of such.

      To give a better glimpse at how this took place, you gotta understand that the load at KAIST was massive. I mean I even cut down on 2 credit points which even when it went down to 4 instead of 6, these 4 credit bastards were still more than what would I be expected to do at USyd, I think the overall workload in terms of contact hours amounted to 63 or 78 hours if not more but certainly more to do at home, I'd say we were expected to double that. This is crazy, for Korean A1 we were literally expected to know Korean alphabet in 2 days, I'm serious, I managed to get ahold of this in a week and still I had some blanks to check. I didn't learn anything beforehand just so you know and this alphabet, perhaps one might say it's not super complicated, one might say it actually is difficult. It certainly becomes such once you need to read simple words and combine letters and knowing the nuances and differences that take place in terms of pronouncing each etc. So me taking a few trips outside, what a bit rattling the cage of a... hm... they probably don't have tigers in Korea, do they? They do have ticks, though. My point being, by taking the trips, you normally can't get to learn or do much learning just because of the planning you have to do and just of how compelling the scenery is, it just automatically dislocates your graze from whatever you're doing outside the window towards the landscape. But staying at campus is also daring for a deathwish, true all I needed was already there but like I said, if I can and feel it's necessary, I'm more of a nomad and seeing the time constraints imposed and that I have a timelimit here in Korea, it became obvious at this point that there will be no other opportunity to see this country, except for now... or never!
    </p>

    <p>
      It's always like that and I always look back and wonder, that I could've stayed where I was, because I won't be returning here likely anytime soon. Still, gotta draw and play my cards and try to gamble for more if there is a real chance. Except I'm a good gambler when I'm in a good mood and free. And one other thing I'll keep concealed but I'll assume all of these were checked, so off I went.</p>

      Jeju was a... wildcard. I did it for a few reasons. I heard of it from a few sources. One, my teacher. Second, my other teacher, who has a house there. Third, my friend from Sydney, who originally comes from Jeju. Forth, I think I might have heard from someone in Poland about Jeju. Fifth, I heard from my buddy in Korea. Sixth, I read about it and found out some interesting stuff. And seventh, I heard about it even more, that people in Korea even import boxes of Oranges from Jeju, because this is the only place that Oranges grow apparently in Korea. In fact, from what I've heard, a lot of food comes from Jeju. Food itself is a very interesting subject in Korea, as apparently it is in a way centrally managed. Poorly managed too, elevating the prices and making space for startups to connect farmers directly to customers and vendors, that's what I've heard from a very well aware buddy. In any case, these Oranges, I didn't eventually get my hand on one but I did on some iced deserts as if Ice cream, without the cream and boy, that was truly the bomb, kind of sugary but with a much more distinct orangy taste, without the acerbity but all the sweetness that comes directly from this one particular Orange that I think I've only tasted on this island. And it might not only be an orange but some other kind of an orange not making it any worse for not being one. But it was also sold as a mixed thing with ice, which was also expensive but how good it tasted... I could have had those for every single day if I were living here... But saying this, I'm kind of making a parallel to the Island itself. It was different. And it was that great, partially, to being an Island, Islands usually are great and a bit different. But also what you could find on this Island, could make you think, that hey, this is paradise. And if you could, you could potentially stay here for the rest of your days, cause why would you not if it's paradise? Of course there are some sides to this paradise that were a bit less satisfactory but I'll explain those soon, which still didn't obscure my impression of where I was and it certainly was - paradise.

      The trip was fast. Two hours by plane, was it? I didn't really have any sleep at all, which takes its toll already. I've been over my trip constructing phases recurrently but hey, in Busan it was plenty of walking. In Seoul, paradoxically, I did a bit of walking too. Then it was a bit of standing at the airport. And then not seeing too much in the plane, because of how tired I was but the flight taking just about 2 hours, I had to get a grip on myself and look forward to the next... about... 24 hours again. Throughout which I found myself not sleeping again. My fault actually, cause I could have took advantage of jjimjilbangs. That kind of sounds like... ahh.. I'll just skip to the point, it's a network of saunas scattered across Korea. These places, usually open 24/7 and these are literally saunas. I really should have taken advantage of at least one, during my stay in Korea, especially on the upcoming night. You just pay once and you stay as long as you'd like. You can get a massage or other stuff or just take a nap. Perfect for tourists and people travelling across the land, especially that it's cheap. Instead, I spent my last 2-3 hours at the shore, trying to figure out what to do with myself and eventually writing a few emails, one sorting out my hopefully last semester at usyd, choosing the master's capstone project topic. I'd like to forget about this part, though. Afterwards it was just enjoying, kinda, a nice walk through a deserted island and streets with little lights on, very islandery small urban scenery and a bit of a hike back to the airport from the shore at the village I was enjoying the sound of the waves crashing against the island over.. and over.
    </p>

    <p>
       I guess it's not a bad way to enjoy your last hours on an island? Along with the preceding walk along the shore, discovering a nicely illuminated with rgb leds bridge, that around 12 hours prior had a great view over a densely populated with bushes creek/river that you could and I did walk along for a white at that earlier time. Fastforward later and reverse back a little with me, continuing my walk down, upwards the shore right to the east of the Island. It is a big island, I could not reach a few recommended destinations, in fact Jeju is one peculiar island. In a few ways. One, that the weather here is kinda crazy, like summer in Sydney. One minute it's cloudy, the next it's sunny but you see these clouds, coming through and obscuring this large, as if volcanic mountain in the very middle of Jeju and so later that day I would get full-on clouds and a bit of rain, although not too much and sun again. Distances are quite huge and the buses, not so frequent. One thing that I truly struggled on this island as it really blocked me from seeing all I wanted: the mountain itself, hiking to which takes a day, apparently at least. Some beaches on the west and east, where it takes at least an hour to get to and the services run on a rather hourly or two basis as well. Then there is the southern part of the island, which I was told is different to the north in such way that it's more tropical. So again something to discover but if I decided to go all the way down, I would have some trouble getting back up. So instead I settled for a few key things, in fact just two in the end. Reaching one a bit more cosy but nevertheless quite magical park. I mean, there was not too much magic about it, except it was pretty, very well managed and maintained. They sold tickets but it was kind of more of a casual thing. Their orange ice pops were absolutely addictive. As most of the area was shaded, the temperature seemed a bit moderate except for the humidity which kept your feeling of cold in check. And so I climbed a bit, cause I figured, there must be a vantage point here, otherwise my friend would have likely not recommended this particular part of island to which it took around an hour and a half to get to. And as I kept on climbing and climbing, one way, the other, eventually I found myself quite deep in bushes, eventually spitting me out on a top, where was nothing... a bit of obscurred view by the bushes... and then an actual wooden construct, from which you could overlook the entire area, all around as you pleased. So good, that it literally knocked you off your feet and made you wonder, oh how good it is to take this short break by hassling oneself all over across the country and the island to just get that particular view, mashed with clouds coming in now and prospecting rain, perhaps even heavy that never came. But the view, over the ocean, over the nearby villages, on the mountain, over the neighbouring hills and a sun piercing through the clouds, making one nice view to gaze on... Hey, I said paradise right?

    <center><h4>Man's gotta eat</h4></center>
   
    <p>
      Ther other thing I had to do was try a black pork BBQ which was unique, endemic to Jeju Island. As I exchanged messages with a friend, I was suggested that I could perhaps try the BBQ at her family's house. And I was like, hell yeah, why not, even if I was told it might come a bit pricey as, if you wanna do a BBQ, you should do it with a minimum of two people. But the thing is, that having an inside knowledge of the culinary is always good when you travel. If you have someone who is/was local, they will have some really good inside knowledge but going a bit further as to see how a bit more traditional, family-led business looks like, that's a bit of a step further. It was a very nice place, the family was expecting me a bit longer than I expected myself to get there, the bus kind of did not quite do the route that naver maps told me it would, so for a bit over 2 kilometers had to be treaded by foot. I did reach the place eventually and it did seem quite traditional. I didn't take photos from what I recall, in such situations I often try to be as normal and polite as possible, so to describe it, you'd have to take off your shoes (from what I recall), take seat at a lowered table Korean style and then the BBQ, which would entail a variety of sides, the BBQ meat (also a variety), sauces and some leafs. I was also ordered, practically quarter across the world also a cold Korean soup. To eat both, I reaaaaally struggled. The soup itself? Very salty. I kind of knew of this taste before, it's very interesting and I'd expect very good to nourish during this weather. I think there was one more thing quite special about it but I'd have to take a look through the messages I exchanged with my friend. The BBQ itself, in terms of the pork, I don't quite remember whether it was that different from the other BBQs I have eaten before. It was just as good factors: crisp, juicy, it might have been about the taste to be a bit more distinct but one thing I have known for sure, this was a really good BBQ, very tasty and something anyone going to Korea should do. Them leaving Korea without trying a BBQ, that's a sin! With the BBQ prepared right in front of your eyes, usually by yourself but I received some help from the family. It was cool to talk a bit, introduce myself and kind of communicate indirectly also with my friend for Australia and directly as well. The family would also showcase how Korean do further with what's served and how I should consume those, which I have known to some extent. I don't even remember all the combinations I have tried, there were at lest one or two that were a bit different to how it was served mainland within the peninsula, I remember I kind of impressed the family with my knowledge of how to eat with sticks. Technically, the sticks in Korea are a bit more challenging, not all of them but such as at campus, you'd deal with sticks that were.. thin. As in, not omnidirectional, you could only rather use them but grabbing with the thin parts. In addition, my friend got me a beer for free. So, I managed to rrrreally eat lots and still not managing to eat everything naturally, due to just how much there was. But, one thing, verrry important that I forgot about. Koreans tend to do these BBQ and serve them... hmm... what was it... it was on a leaf, a special kind, a bit of the BBQ dipped in the sauce and some salad and it was kind of a like a perfect mini keto-wrap, that tasted like heaven. But I could not imagine, that heaven could become even brighter, more exciting and remarkable as this one, where the prime difference laid in providing and using a... perilla leaf. Perhaps it sounds normal, I don't know, that was the first time I encountered this, before it was just a typical salad/iceberg salad leaf but this perilla one just made all the difference in the world, the bouquet of flavours that run through all this, exhilarating experience. I had absolutely no doubt about how fresh the ingredients were, how each counted into this complex taste the one bite of this wrap delivered, the juiciness and crispness of barbequed black pork, the exoticness and hints of the anissey, liquoricey, minty taste of this subtle but kind of bit plant-like midly yet very subtly hairy taste, the sweetness of the sauce and some of the spicess used with a slight twist here and there. Holy mother of god, this was seriously good! Even though the family would recommend me to eat with some other ingredients, I would stick to the perilla experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The place I was at, I'm not sure how to describe it exactly, except for the table I was seated at. There was another family having lunch right next door, if I could call it next door as it was more of a sliding door. This family definitely was seating traditionally, I don't remember if I was. I communicated in English and simple Korean. There was from what I recall, a larger part of the family, so that I found very interesting, I just hope I wasn't too much of a bother and still a good persop to communicate with at the time, considering how I become after longer loads, especially during my travels, it could have been either way but I think it was okay. From the outside, it looked like any place along a highway in many European countries, an eatery along the way. Inside, it was more of a traditional Korean place that was accustomed to locals to eat the traditional BBQ. Apparently, all they prepare for the food is also made and harvested organically. That's a cool thing too, which I found in Korea as one of the very good things. You remember I mentioned Korea is a bit of a fusion between China and Japan, and that it takes in many cases the best of each west and east? Well, in case of food, it's a bit weird cause China didn't blow me away and Japan in terms of ingredients, it wasn't easy to get those in-store. In fact, in Korea it was not that different. But on Jeju I assume the conditions to cultivate fruits and veggies are optimal, so most will be sourced locally. But the point I'm trying to reach and lead towards is also, that Korea is not quite a super high-tech country, from the outside, yes, it does look like that, just simply say Samsung or LG, in fact the first sometime ago was literally 20% of the country's GDP, which creates some other issues that I might talk about at a different blog. They do own quite their own but compared to Lotte, their appearance in Korea is somewhat under the radar, as if concealed, their stores look just as majesticly designed as in the west but their presence, limited. LG seems more ubiquitous as their even a telco here, perhaps Samsung is somewhat involved too but even though they are either an owner or a shareholder of a chain of grocery stores, they are not called Samsung. I thought it's interesting to mention that. And, seeing this, despite that yes their industry is very strong and high tech, once you roll into Korea you will very soon discover the very traditional side of it, the really older side as if left a bit behind overall, not quite but it's as if there are two equidistant worlds thriving within the same one large small, split in half peninsula. And somehow, you do get to really like each, in terms of the traditional part, the food I was served here: absolutely stunning and I would remain to have such a great experience overall in Korea altogether. Afterwards it was me paying, thanking and hitting of to that park I mentioned, to get to which was a bit of a hassle but the views, I don't know what was better, the perilla leaf BBQ wrap or the view over there. Both knocked my consciousness out in a beautiful way.

      As much as the prodigy would not quite befit the feel of the island, the island itself was quite a bit of the prodigy. These two things I have had checked and earlier than that I had the opportunity to get lost with the bus, twice in a row in fact as the stops are quite distant from one another and would throw me out exactly where I should have kept away from. There were a few more destinations that I could have gone to and locating myself with naver maps was a bit weird as their system kind of showcases the available buses in a bit of a way I am just simply not used to. Before that however, once I dropped of the airport I managed get some cash out or on, which was very weird, oh no I actually tried to get some money on my T-Money as I got the funds eventually on my account but still had to deal with limitations and so I paid an uneven amount and as the man at the convenience store struggled he took the money but introduced a slightly higher amount and said that's okay. Felt weird at the time but also very interesting and welcoming (I think it was like, I tried to get 1500 KRW on to the card but only 2000 could be uploaded). As it was early morning I decided to find a 7-eleven to get my daily dose of Pocari Sweat, a Japanese electrolyte mix I fell in love with in Korea (and which seems to be everywhere and quite popular and tasty). And reach the shore... which I was not to sure... so funny, cause one thing you notice, suddenly the place is covered in a deep, thick fog... which kept on moving. I was like, what the hell? Did the clouds suddenly go down, so low that I'm in heaven?
    </p>

    <p>
      This was no heaven, though. I think it's called a mist in the end and that's what Islanders will get at times. One place, no mist, down there at what would seem a public school, quite a bit of it and moving. Really magical entry to this island, wouldn't you say? Especially once I moved and suddenly found myself at the shore, with very weird as if volcanic rocks down as if the Island burried on it. And the mist, which blended with the entire area in a very soft... quieting manner... Disclosing eventually much more but the view and how the sun was scattering its rays through this mist... Maaan... even though I didn't sleep, I felt refreshed with all this plus the saltiness of the air, definitely due to the mist itself. Like I said, the weather was unpredictable but it did welcome me in a very unique but also on my end, a very welcoming manner. From there, a bit of scouring around, hitting a shop, getting local frozen stuff and eventually making my way to BBQ place and getting lost along the way. I think I described all bits in pieces now, except for the evening when I was coming back from the park. Yes, one blank left there: I hit the first village I came across on this day, as the sun was coming down so I was really hardboiled on getting the sunset in my DSLR lens. Eventually, it was kind of a fight with windmills, as I did not get quite in time but the light was still up and so I managed to get a bit of material after which? Two things. Can't remember in what order, one really amazing cafe with levels that were consecutively being closed down due to later hours, where they had a small library, lots of places to read and charge your phone and other stuff and a quite good coffee. I was sent some amazing pictures by a friend of mine of some other places deeper in the Island, it's sad I didn't get to visit them. But still, getting a cup was a necessity considering of what crazy hours were waiting for me later. Not crazy, just, during which I had to do something with myself. And then some other place I think I scavanged with my tripadvisor, which would serve soup-like dishes with fish. I think that was the case at least, I can't exactly remember what it was except, that it was good. And I liked the sides again, rice and kimchi, yaaay! Again, traditional setting, good taste/price ratio and it was relatively going a bit later night hours too and quite busy as well so I was lucky to score a seat. I think I even managed to get a bit my phone charged so that was a win. After which, a walk down the shore, over the illuminated bridge, passing before a set of restaurants/bars and hotels, in many what it seemed was they were serving fish. But surprisingly, on Jeju it didn't quite seem as if the fish were that super popular. Even despite them having a bit of an endemic culture and even that place I have been with the fish soup, it was considered apparently local and endemic and those certainly were. But it didn't seem as if in many other places the same arrangement was being served. Perhaps down south it's a bit different? Couldn't tell, I didn't manage to explore that much, very unfortunately.
    </p>

    <p>
      But hey, this is a pardise. It's not like you get to go to a paradise for just nearly one day. That's ridiculous, isn't it? Why would I do this in the end? I should have spent much longer. Like my friend who after studying went to work on a farm there and explore a fair bit. I didn't get free time after all this, I had to speed back to Australia and go right into my, well, let's call it final semester at this faculty. So getting this island checked, I thought, I just had to do it. And I was very obliged to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coming back was, kiiiinda okay. Reaching the airport. Struggling not to fall asleep on a bench by the shore beforehand. And then packing myself onto the plane and kinda willing to fall asleep but once I looked out the window... Oh my... The view was... Down there, travelling by train, you see all this beauty and you really appreciate it. Koreans? Not quite so much, not all the time, many taking the train are just working and are occupied with their own devices. Some are sleeping and get woken up by the attendants which I find quite cool, as the sytem is automatized and they know exactly who is supposed to be where and when they are taking off. But up there, you can a complete different perspective. In fact, in most cases the view from up in the sky is mesmerising, Earth is beautiful, especially from the distance but up-close, it just kind of correlates to one another. Still, the combination of hills and mountians, and lakes, and rivers, and forests, and sibling cities, and... the sea so close and all of that blending in the distance and the sun scouring back from the lakes the plane was hovering through... Having the opportunity to see all this and having quite clear skies, I was so incredibly lucky and if you ever go to Korea, you better hope for such views too.
    </p>

    <p>
      I landed not quite far for Daejeon. The airport was kind of in the middle of nowhere, I planned on getting a train but those were quite infrequent, so despite covering a lot by foot, like over a kilometer or two to the station, I went back and waited for a bus that went over one city and then eventually reaching Daejeon, from which... what did I do afterwards? Was I so crazy I decided to just go to see a lake, over a dam east of Daejeon? According to my location history that is exactly what I have done. The view again was... actually it was fair, maybe a bit more. It also took some legwork to get there and then I was dying in the scorching hot day, waiting for the bus, for which I had also waited even before that, the connecting one and getting lost once again. There's not much to say, except that I was feeling as if dying and then once I was again en route and took a connecting option back to Kaist, I think I just dropped dead at the Dormitory. And had to deal with my feet being in a severely bad shape.

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Paradise Another</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      Seoraksan National Park was a destination that I was recommended as a place, as I have shown the map of Korea and asked 'what about here?', 'what about there?'. South West was a nah, still kind of in my plans but eventually deterred, although there was one destination down down south, kind of difficult to get to but as an alternative, Seoraksan seemed much more compelling, a totally different part of Korea, possible to get by train right far to the east but getting to the national park? That was a hurdle for a few reasons. First I had to get a ticket to Gangneung which was easy. But what was less easy was to get up very early in the morning, as it was about 6 o'clock. That a bit of a murderous time, the thing was I had nothing on Wednesday but I was also living with two other flatmates, who were very cool but also rather quiet people, I didn't want to be that different and so to disturb them I had all I needed packed the night before (I think I did?). One of the first buses start showing up at 6 and this could have been the time when I kind of reached the station slightly too late, as I decided to take, on one hand a slightly different route to a KAIST bus stop, not knowing exactly where it was and then taking one bus all the way till the end of its route, which threw me out, well... a bit down south from the station. Very weird but I had to make the rest of the trip to the station by foot, taking me approximately... 20? 30 minutes? So me starting the actual trip at around 8:30 from Daejeon Railway was still not so bad of a start. Getting the ticket was very straightforward as ever with Korail ticket, showed up at the box: I wanna go to this station asap and there I had it, boom, a ticket and after a few minutes I was speeding to get into my coach. This KTX was just as any, I had a little bit of time at Seoul station so I think I might have just grabbed something at maccas, like a somewhat a mango shake was it? And then to the train, which turned out as quite cool thing, with a power socket and all. The trip itself? These KTXs were different, more comfortable but what was even better was the views, perhaps a bit more obscurred with tunnels and by the villages it passed through but at times, the view was so pure and majestic with the mountain ranges at the back. Kind of reminded me of Sydney and... Bavaria.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got off in Gangneung and from there, I kind of looked around the station, figured whether I had time to eat, noticed a bit larger military presence in terms of individuals in military clothing and then after figuring I had to get to the park asap, I packed myself into the public bus and drove off to the bus terminal. This is a bit not handy, at all, this is not the only example, even Seoul does not quite seem to have a combination of train and bus terminals, instead these tend to be seperated, at times quite far and the cities in Korea tend to be very widespread, so going by foot around is a total no-no, especially when it's scorching hot outside, was it above 35 degrees + almost no shade and concrete poured all over, feeling it's well above 40 degrees? What helps is the T-Money card, with which you can travel, practically anywhere in the country. Using the occassion, I forgot to mention that Korea has some weird thing with Dick Parks. At least two that I know on Jeju Island, that I didn't have time to visit and somewhere else in the country, where there is just simply a Park, with sculpted Dicks in all forms and sizes. I even thought of travelling to see this, cause I don't know of any other park in the world, where the main attraction you find are just simply dicks in a park, this would certainly entertain many of my friends, questioning my sexual orientation and potentially triggering Facebook's and or Instagram's AI systems. The reason why I'm probably mentioning it may be that this one park somewhere on the east might not be accessible by the T-Money card. Idk, that's just to showcase how different Korea can be but in many cases, the subject does not make it particularly bad, in the end somehow this country does manage to defend itself whatever you'd be doing. For instance, the national park, despite I had such a hassle underway in the end, it was worth it. And so I reached Gangneung's Intercity Bus Terminal at... around 12:30. Now it's been getting late but I was also a bit confused with the tickets. In the end, I think I purchased one from the machine, a cheaper ticket... the buses were not told in regards to where they depart from, I bought something good at the bakery within the terminal and then managed to figure out somehow where the bus was departing from, I think somehow by myself, two buses pulled up. What I don't get is how they differentiate the pricing of these tickets, I had the cheaper one but I swear it was the express to Sokcho. Also, these buses were unbelieveably comfortable. In fact, so much that, imagine that: they had reclining seats! And they were very spacious as well and many of the buses were exactly like this from what I've travelled. I don't remember if they had power sockets... they might have had USB chargers, though. And this bus, it took around an hour to get to Sokcho. From where... another change to a... public bus, that had many many stops along the coast and deeper into the mountains... all the way up to Seoraksan National Park, closer to which there were lesser stops but more detours. In the end... I arrived there after 2 PM. Do you get it? I woke up at 6 and only managed to reach the mountains at bloody 2 PM. That's ridiculous and I knew I had only perhaps, 3 or 4 hours here, cause I also had to return and the buses stop at some point as well...
    </p>

    <p>
      I think I only managed to catch a bus at 7 pm back. That was one of the last calls, I literally was speeding not knowing whether this is the last one, because the park itself, also closes at some point, perhaps just about at this time. From there, it was Sokcho and yet again, one of the last buses to Seoul. I had problems, though. On one hand, finances were tight and I was expected to pay more than I should have. The computer would not sell me stuff on my debit card and after approaching the second time the cashier, she realised: oh yes, there are some discounted seats after all and I managed to get that ticket, get quickly some water and pocari sweat from the convenience store right next to the terminal and then blaze my way into the bus which was just about to depart. I think I'm really pushing it all too far. This bus, went straight to Seoul, an express one and despite it was already after sundown, the views were still quite something to enjoy. The trip to Sokcho, also had all these mountain ranges to enjoy watching. It's a bit different from the highway compared to really amazing train routes and astonishing flight view but it was still not too bad and at times really good. The trip to Seoraksan from Sokcho also had quite a bit too look at, if you had the seat. I arrived at Seoul after 10 pm and yet again, I had to get to Seoul Central Station ASAP from the eastern bus terminal. The trip took half an hour and I had to get some advise from a pair of drunk students, basically the problem was that the same metro line would go in seperate directions, if it did one of them, I would be in a very bad situation. Eventually, I was lead by one of the students to the connection metro line which was very kind. In the end, Koreans are not that different from Europeans in terms of the drinking culture and also being helpful in such situation. Then, I had literally the last train to Daejeon, at 11 PM, not too much of a last call but the margin was really tight. From there though, I yet again, deprived of my bus connections to KAIST, I took it upon myself, to do yet again, or one of the first times? The long 2 hour walk back to KAIST, which had at least 2 stops along the way, to eat, rehydrate myself at a convenience store, enjoy the nature along the river path (and a cycling path btw, they have it really nicely done here) and eventually crashing dead back at the dormitory. Uff! Wow. Pushing to the limit. Hell yeah, I manage to write it all. It was actually a pretty good story. One true story. But I am serious, if anyone doubts this, let me know and I'll send you my google location records and additional proof if you need it.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what exactly have I been doing in between these lengthy travels? And what was I actually doing during them? In regards to the second question, I have no answer. Which saddens me but that is the truth, absolutely no idea anymore whatsoever. As for the first question, I have some details for you.

    <p>
      There are times when you go hiking and you need to do a whole lot of it to reach something of really high and magnificent importance to your eyes. Like one of my trips to a lookout near where I live in Sydney. Literally nothing until the view, which took a lot of time and coconut water, 15 minutes and satisfied I'm off. See, Seoraksan was something extremely on the contrary. Once I entered it, for which I had to pay not too much but some KRWs, like perhaps it was 3000 ? I just entered it and it was cool. But a few minutes later, I reached a bridge from which the views start like holy...
    </p>

    <p>
      I was very surprised to see this. It was after 2 PM, so I'd actually consider this mid-day in the middle of a very hot and summery Korea. I was at the time of summer where rains already have dropped so I was lucky. Now it was just scorching hot and nothing above that + a bit low depth of water coming down from the mountains. Still, despite the time, the mountains were staggeringly lovely. The delight of musing on this cluster of rocks, both on the river path and the much larger in the background, covered in slight blueish blanket, the trees so seemingly fresh and intensive green and the clear skies. It was so picturesque that I could not help but take my DSLR and take a series of attempts at making a full-frame selfie. One of which remains as my profile pic, it was just that good and with a slight bit of post-process it became even better. The joy of being here? Quite grand after all these changes but I kind of was looking forward to something good. After all, this buddy, 90% of what he said and intended was amazing. This? Was nothing other. Afterwards I took a short detour to a cafe nearby, I was yearning for coffee, see. And how happy I was to see they had single origin options... so many interesting ones that I was like, holy moly, where do they source: Yemeni beans, Cuban beans... Super expensive. I think I got the first version, although ethically speaking perhaps I shouldn't have... Although I might actually got myself something else but I don't remember, just the fact that the coffee was interestingly served, with the espresso, a glass of hot water and a glass of cold water and that the coffee tasted very much like wild berries, at least the espresso, very much like like a strong and poignant combination of just plain wildberries, with the hot water, a more delicate taste and that this coffee cost 15000 KRW, so yeah, expensive, normal Americano from the best coffee place I know in the world right outside KAIST costs like 2000 and single origin on the spot, 3500. But I needed that caffeine, even if the portion I received was grand... but it kept me going for the rest of the day, just that I shouldn't be doing this when I'm bloody hiking!
    </p>

    <p>
      Up next, I kind of got convinced to take the cable car, damn thing cost 10000 KRW both ways. But the cost was ultimately diminished by the exhilirating view to the north and east. I spent a good hour there, looking around and discovering all that this trip offered. The lookout itself... which had an amazing view on the east and south, yes I said that. The skies were clear so I could see the entire village/city of Sokcho and a few others bit more up north. Then, I went west, where I found myself at a ridge... overlooking the full spectrum of the high mountain ridges, probably some of the largest the southern part of Korea has to offer. This part... reminded me of America. Despite I have never been there before. I have seen a bit of Korea to this point and the natural part for most reminded me very much of Europe, which was not a bad association, after all the wildlife and flora do look alike. But I have not seen such steep mountains in Europe and certainly not so nearly orangey, that's how I figured that this part could have more in relation to the states after all! There was some mist covering a bit further down, the view was great and interestingly, there were no safety precautions made here, so if you overdid your thing, you could have ended up all the way down. A beautiful, poetic way to end a life I guess, except carcasses likely won't judge the beauty of anything and the spectators would rather scream appalled by the sight of someone vanishing from the face of the ridge. This here, great view over the west, deep into the mountains, into which I could not go deep due to time. The park has quite extensive routes and I could unfortunately only taste a small bit of it. Well this and some other area but I'll get to it eventually. Up there I still had one more direction to go to and I discovered some sort of a shrine, unattended overall. I just took a quick look around and after seeing there's nothing more I head back up and then down with the cable car, there were a bit of tourists there by the way.

    <p>
      Unfotunately, to all the great, a caveat must exist. It didn't have to but it did end up like this as I was referred by the buddy to check out this one waterfall area. I'll spare you of all the details of me getting there, which I knew would take too long but I said, fuck it, I'll do it anyway. This fuck it cost me almost 2 hours and all my strengths after that were depleted. It wasn't just me climbing a bit, there was a small waterfall, if you could call it that was, kind of a creek and a bit more up something more but, there was nothing. I was sure there would eventually be something though and to get to this something though I had to climb... was it around a 1000 steps? All I recall, they were neverending and at some point my legs, not feet not even feet but actual legs started to give in, just going a bit limp and me, with all my equipment on my backpack which amounted to around 7-10 kilo and me all covered in sweat, I'm not joking I don't think there was a single part of my body that did not sweat at this point of the day. With the day coming slowly to an end and me realising and and knowing that it might cost me my travel back to KAIST. But it didn't cost me this and I made sure I gathered the rest of my strength and got all the way up. All the way to a lookout, achieving which gave me a short blizz of satisfaction until I prompty realised it was overlooking... a waterfall. With the sole exception and absence of the waterfall itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fuck I was angry now but also gave up nearly up and there. I started descending once I realised I could potentially do the really steep all the way down. I kind of managed to inform the world how this part got me down and how I had to start hurrying, despite being really totally depleted of all my energy, all the way back to the entrance, where I was told nah, I should go around to the exit which was elsewhere. But I packed myself into the bus, then to another bus then to a metro then to a train and then... again, 2 hours of walking. Damn it, I still managed to tie up a lot of these loose ends and I think I managed to achieve the impossible, nobody else did that kind of a trip, yet alone in just one day but how rewarding this trip was with the festival of colours and bright, vividness and vibrance, just the pure nature of all its beautiful colours and how trips to national parks should always look like. Always look like so amazing, cause it was just pure amaze and might of the mountain range right over here and even the lack of the waterfall and me dropping nearly dead at the dormitory after doing all this walking and commuting, it was all... worth it.
    </p>

    <p>
      And I would do it again and even more, preferably with other people or a person, because as it turned out, Korea did offer and deliver and still there is much more to be discovered in so many lengths. It is certainly different in many cases, in very much a lot of widths and angles it will seem like what you know but hey, if you're getting a pizza in Korea, you will get a very special pizza. If you want toast, this toast will be different. If you want a national park, this national park will be different too, along with coffee, liquor, karaoke and transport and somehow this nation managed to get all this in a frame that is just simply fascinating for all the people from abroad. And hey, soju is cheap here too!
