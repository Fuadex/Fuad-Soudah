      The funny thing about my travels is that they often turn out unexpected. No matter how difficult I make it for myself, somehow I manage to land just about right but in the end it all becomes too much and even when I don't entirely notice it all at first, the reality does a number on my senses and I become overwhelmed, and limited to the squeezed perception I am finally left. I've never been in Athens. And while I've read just a tiny bit about Singapore, I learned almost nothing about Athens beforehand. So I asked a friend from Greece for recommendations. And it turned out she actually comes from Athens and that I could stay at her family's place for a bit. As I'm usually stringent on myself, being subject to others' hospitality, I figured I'd just remain for maybe a day utmost, which became just that as I set up a following flight to Dusseldorf. But how things turn... unexpected. And really fantastic as my stay exceeded what I hoped to see.

    I arrived in the morning at Athen's airport. I received some extra info that the metro might not work but trains should. And I just pushed a few messages to say hello from the land of Philosophers, Theater and... soon I was to discover. The airport itself didn't make too much of an impression. It was far away from the city from what it seemed on the map... and it felt quite old. But I managed to figure out swiftly how to reach the metro/train line and entering EU was just as fast as usual, with me, as usual, being in posession of a Shengen passport, therefore heading into a shorter line. Turned out the metro line did run all the way from the airport to the city center... Let me just say that the route is around 36 km long. It's a metroline. And train seem to run there too, with the metro going every 20 minutes or so. That is impressive, considering there is almost nothing for around the first 20 km or so, except for some nice views of the Balkan peninsula, rich with raggedy hills and a mix of orangey/olive landscape. That is a nice landscape... A bit differs from what I experience up north, reminding me a bit of Australia at its driest but the weather here was alike Australia at this time of the year, so a coat/jacket was just about right for now, along with the long pants. The trip cost me 10 Euros one-way and for the limit of 90 minutes, I figured that was a fair deal. The spectrum of people in the metro was also a bit interesting, as there were musicians with accordion playing, a beggar and many people just on their way to work. I still can't figure out the language, though. My first stop? Getting myself an ISIC card...
  </p>

  <p>
    This was a bit problematic, believe me or not but the information was quite straightforward, although as it turned out - misleading. When it clearly said I could get the card done at any, what seemed like a international telecommunication merger, at first I patiently awaited to be noticed by someone and then lead to reach some place around the corner that would say, that yes I can do a card here. After a bit of struggling, I found the place. And it was a tour bureau, where I explained my situation to the two ladies there, they suggested I needed a new photo, I said that one I had was fine and then I filled out a form, gave the old photo, received a new ID and in the process got it for University of Sydney rather than KAIST (long story but I have an ID from a university with a long expiry date) and I paid, got my change and then I figured I can go out as a proper student and discover places around, which turned out to not be quite the case as yes, students have free entry but only from EU, from outside there are just discounted tickets and a combination-tickets, which entitle to see the major destination points. I also started off with a bakery, where I bought myself a cup of Greek Coffee (tasted like arabic, as in plainly brewed and unfiltered, strong), some local pastries and a bottle of fizzy ouzo mix. After sharing the news with my friend and her siblings who would get updated along now, I started my day by discovering the key areas around Athens. A bit tired, disorganised but I managed to see on my way almost all the attractions listed on my combination ticket (+ one more I bought along the way), with the centerpoint of Akropolis. This cost me 15 Euros (+ extra 3, as I was not aware of how much I could see that day). I made a round and saw the Agora, stretched out to the west and then pierced through Monastiraki and arched the area on my way Akropolis Museum and checking off a few extra destination points my ticket covered. By the way, the process of ticket validation was surprisingly chill, in fact I think the ticket thing might be only as of quite recent as the infrastructure is just not quite in place everywhere and you can see a lot even by not entering it at all, except for Akropolis and Agora areas. Oh, also Parthenon was being renovated. Didn't know they could do that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I really liked... in fact, most of the areas I've gone through had this particular tint if I may frame it. Authenticity that manifested in a variety of forms but as it did, I connotated it with a variety of other countries that I have visited along the way. In terms of how many archeological locations there were out in the open, it seemed like Rome. In terms of the unique buildings' outlook in a specific, whitey at a wider perspective style, it felt like Amman. Orange trees along the streets were a bit like Barcelona and the associations continued as I kept on streaming my consciousness onto the brother who started showing me around the city. I think I was showcasing my awe, on how many elements felt like other cities but still this one felt like a standalone, an original, which seemed about right as I think historically the cultural elements kind of sprawled around the region. Athens apparently did get hit throughout history and many of the relicts of the past did not remain in place... but in the end, many of it did and the contemporary feel is somewhat infused with a hint of its own like Monastiraki, as if more of a flea markety feel but heavily infused with urban art (as in Graffiti), further down in not so hidden maze of tight alleyways. 'Now that's kind of Berlin!' - I would remark but in fact, it wasn't - more as if infused with further down Middle East or closer - turkish cityscape. As I once remarked, it had a specific feel to it in connection with what I've seen but original as a standalone.

  <p>
    After visiting a really good Akropolis museum, as in how modern-looking and well designed it was with plethora of space and well presented archeological work, in such a style that I figured, hell a museum where this particular art is showcased and I liked I could count on one hand, even if someone chopped a finger or two: British Museum, Seoul's National and then, here you go, Athens provided a very nice joint where all seemed to be in harmony and perspective (also I think it was cheap but can't recall the pricerange). I found eduroam in the museum too and after exchanging communication with the brother, I met him shortly outside where a few ladies seemed to have been giving out flowers (although I'm a sceptic of anyone giving out anything for free at major tourist attraction spots) and off we went to do another short walk, during which I spammed with my thoughts, my journey, what I've seen and how much I liked the city with the myriad of references I thought of having identified. Then we discussed the nature of my studies, his studies, differences and references, and much more, from Monastiraki we took a detour upward the hill, where we crashed outside of a restaurant/tavern. I really enjoyed the view from up there, as it overlooked the north-western bank of Athens. And after having a variety of foods ordered by the brother, taken by a bit as if tired waiter, we proceeded to talk about all sorts of things and stuff for throughout the coming sundown and afterwards we rediscovered a bit of Athens after dark, which does feel quite unique again at that time, which reminded me of... something else but I couldn't quite tell at the time. Today, I think it was at a town near Geneva which had an alike warm vibe.
  </p>

<p>
  Either way, around and at this point I have started being subjected to a very unfamiliar to me, although it was actually quite but I didn't expect to be treated such surprisingly well, to the point I was expected to let be paid for the food and drinks I was consuming. All I ever hoped for was some suggestions in relation to where to go and what to visit, at least that's usually my starting point from where I could explore more details of the city and evaluate how much time I might have to discover the rest. But it all grew much sooner to discovering first-hand the knowledge, history, cuisine and life of the city and the people who live here and the incredible culture of hospitality that I was truly not aware to any extent and felt a little bit unsettled with. I had to kindly refuse larger amounts of ouzo at the tavern and later on after the stroll at home, where the family was looking forward to meeting the guest and eventually also going out at night, all mostly due to the loose end in the form of a capstone research project/thesis that I just had to finish up. Truthfully, reading it through, sorting the appendix and making sure it all quite made sense took me around 3 hours, even after having been properly caffeinated. At this point I kind of felt like the winner. Apart, I had one more project due in 2 days, more of a journal and eventually my coordinator didn't quite like what I've submitted. Buuut, that's lifeee I gueeesss?
</p>

<p>
  The next day, we had breakfast and we departed to the airport, as the brother had work and from what I learned he had and has lots of it with university workload to top it off. This time, I was a little less talkative, I think there's a limit to the amount of subjects I can cover in such a short period of time, with me willing to stream all of them one after another. And once the volume is depleted, I struggle finding the right details and formula. Or that could also be the effect of the grandeur amount of research details I had to rewind through and finish in the last weeks, with not that much sleep that I was getting. It all eventually crashes, although my head does that in the form of an ABS breaking system. Still, I remained quite confident and talked a bit more, finding positives and making sure I was alive. The suburbian terrain of where the family lives is a quite nice area. From what I've learned, it's very tough to find a parking spot. There were orange trees all over and along the streets, although I was told these were not quite oranges but a similar citrus-like plants. I still loved seeing them and the buildings had their feel to them. A bit different from what I've remembered seeing over Akropolis, as in this beautiful white objects spanning over the cityscape. Here, in between I've been seeing a bit more like... Naples in a more Balkan form but a very neat looking with, again a very specific authentic feel. I must remark that my first entry to the city didn't quite provide with such an amount of details as these eventually arrived. Maybe because at first I saw a bit of Zagreb from the metroline I bounced off. But with the backalleys hiding remarkable Italian-like spots with vegetation climbing all over taverns and tighter streets giving a glimpse on the culture and history of this city, with just a few metrolines, a shore I have not been to and hills/mountains within your grasp, I think all of it kind of converges into one original destination which is called Athens.
