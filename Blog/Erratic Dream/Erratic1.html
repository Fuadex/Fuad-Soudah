    <center><h4>Update no. ?</h4></center>
    That's likely my first update for my refubrished Blog site. Every now and then I will take a look back at my website and figure that, you know what? I could introduce a few more fixes to make it look better!<br><br>

    Despite that I already now believe and see that it is not quite bad, all in all, although that's understandable considering what sort of considerable amount of work was put towards its creation, design and development. Somewhat like an RnD, an abbreviation I heard notoriously although could not quite figure out what it stood for. Although I did, more or less.<br><br>

    This time however, I will be looking for something new.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Whaba Dubba Dub Dub!</h4></center>
    My first idea that laid foundation for this website was a rather simple one - I just wanted to figure out what I'm capable of, what my strengths and weaknesses are whether I have actually work that I could showcase to anyone that could potentially be willing to employ someone, perhaps within the scope of what my skills are, that were about to be seen.<br><br>

    And guess what? I manage to scramble quite a large portion, widespread selection of works that were still being conducted while I was being overseas. That was actually one of my craziest ideas that I could come up with, despite having a garganteous amount of work to undertake in relation to 48 ECTS-points worth units (!!!!!) (that's like taking 36-42 CP) I just came up with the idea that, hey, let's make a website, which would also function as a personal hub. In fact, it would only function as a personal hub. An aggregate of all my skills. The bloody thing took between 2-4 weeks to make but I was relatively happy with the results, even if the general outlook coming out from the website was a gloomy mixture of spections.<br><br>

    While at the time the primary idea was to see what I can do and to create a foundation to support, let's assume a library which I had to fill up with the books scattered all over the god damned world. And I'm not joking, some of the materials were back in Australia on my PC, which is a marvelous mess on its own as it went through a number of new Windows.<br><br>

    Nevertheless, this time it will be strictly for personal development. Therefore still, the primary idea holds of hosting an aggregate, although this time, I will be putting a bit more experimental ideas into it and making use of what interesting styling ideas I have. In addition and actually moreover, I have noticed that I may be bugging some of my friends to a quite annoying extent. It is obviously not my intent to do so, rather just socialise and exchange in information, that is rather often trivial and limited to memes and ridiculous/outrageous contents. I do however see that much fo what I exchange is lost forever in the oblivion of Facebook. Therefore I will be making an attempt at writing significantly more on my personal website, although I'll need to figure out how to introduce an effective system as the number of .html files will overpower what I have.<br><br>

    Part of a designer's job is to see patterns. Primarily where they exist, obviously, can't go out see stuff that does not exist there in the first place, can I now?<br><br>

    Anyway, one of the patterns I have noticed, although it gets better and worse every now and then but in general, personally, I have a relatively low self-esteem of my communication skills. I have been reminded recurrently, that this is an issue and I see the impact it's making. I actually do know what to blame for this but since I cannot exactly address that issue yet, I will try to assume a positional stand and improve via equivalent methods: reading books (AT FUCKING LAST), playing video games (got enough horsepower), watching movies and TV Shows.<br><br>

    Also, reading my old stuff and merging it into the new style could be an idea.<br><br>

    So, anyway, let me get bit more concise. I'll be starting a new branch of my blogs called Erratic Dreams. I'm going off on a trip and a short-term exchange. From Minto (25th, 3.30 am) Sydney (25th, 6 am) to Cairns (25th, 9 am) to Osaka (25th, 7.30 pm), to Fukuoka (26th, 12.15 pm) to Daegu (27th, 3.55 pm) to Daejeon (27th, 7 pm ?). In general I somewhat enjoy undertaking trips that are relatively intricate. Instead of going just into one place, I tend to do a lot of stops and make sure everything is kept within the relatively low-cost frame. Just so I can see as much as possible.<br><br>


    On the other hand I plan on increasing the UX of this particular website and the only few ways to do it is by cleaning the code and introducing new features that go along with UX. I plan on changing many of my past projects to fit the dimensions of greatly executed UX-wise projects, but we'll see how time allows that.<br><br>
