      When the process comes to an end, conclusions get drawn. Time goes by and new events take form in the horizon. I looked back at what I went through and held on to what might have remained or became gone in the end. Just realizing too many way too late, relapsing through all the events once again. The scary was coming now and I was hit twice quite hard, about to just now in Singapore especially.
    </p>

    <p>
      I should become a bit more immune to all this but in all the world's unfairness, I feel I'm being subjected to a little bit too much of the more frustrating part. And it's especially frustrating when, despite all the work you put and you feel confident about, you turned out lower than expected compared to some that you just know did not quite deserve what they received. This can be easily said in any of the forms I have mentioned in regards to myself. Still getting back, proved to be an effort.

    And the food in the city is quite different now that I think about it too. After all, I have one of the best kebab places in the area I was living in. Apparently, there is a coffee roastery just nearby too, which I sadly did not manage to visit during my brief stay. Shops are literally everywhere... What I keep finding Warsaw and Poland as a standalone to have an upperhand over other European even countries, is just the crazy amount of shops, with the scene so radically saturated that I find it difficult to comprehend how they still manage to create growth, keep opening new shops and just make money, cause there is just such a variety, all from convenience stores, towards discount stores, delicatessen, supermarkets, costco-alike and hypermarkets so even larger than the prior with new places being opened related to wholefoods and ecological and/or vegan stores of different sizes. In my area alone, in the radius of 5 km, I think you may find a fair double digit number of stores, coming closer towards triple digits. There are also more being opened and developed anyway but not that many bars or restaurants on the other hand which is weird. But most of these, you'll find in Warsaw with some chain stores that offer very high quality of foods for a very good price. Like Viking chain, where you just show up, choose what you want, grab a drink on your way out. A huge selection. Maccas got a bit worse recently but the fastfoods in this country are literally called restaurants and considering the foods they serve, they literally are restaurants, many of the franchises managed actually by the Polish. And then there are the smaller venues... and coffee places with chains being remarkably presentable. Somehow I'm seeing a shift towards serving quality and improving the quality of already offered merchandise, which is a very welcoming trends that I'm following in Poland. Even food at Ikea felt as if just better compared to other countries I've been visiting this chain in. It's still cheap but there's also a great selection span, if you're willing to grab a craftbeer, there will usually be quite a few to choose from. And some of the local produce that is just simply not available elsewhere than in Poland, primarily limited to particular fresh juices but not just.

  The other thing, although as I should call it, the people. Sure, maybe outsiders and just strangers do not seem particularly welcoming this time of the year. But my friends somehow do remain and what this time I realised again, was actually a couple of things. How much they progressed. How much I stayed behind in some lengths. How tired I still was. And how good certain things are that I forgot about. Specific types of alcohol... Mate tea... I mean, some of my friends are literally experts in this matter and I envied and really praised and was a bit taken aback but mesmerised by just how good it all have been and the knowledge they had and shared. Wow... This is a fact, many of the friend I have visited presented me as if with worlds that I have not been quite in touch with for a while, just because I was focusing on my studies and primarily just that with a bit of withdrawal periods. I always knew how damaging that all was... but I just could not go out of this shell and figure out how much was out there and how much my friends and far they've gone and how many changes have happened and why do I keep being invited here and there and being treated that well as clearly I remain having communication issues and especially with me being so tired... I rediscovered some video games, how fun they can be. I rediscovered cuisines and many of the old games I have long forgotten but spent countless of hours on. Some of my friends that I have not seen in an even longer while and seeing what they do, how places that I've known more than 10 years ago have either changed or didn't at all. Just recollecting how the environment looks radically different at specific times of the year. A rapid onslaught of reminiscence which is good but also druggy, especially once I started rediscovering why in the end I do not settle here for longer. Freedom is a precious thing and I love cultivating it. And Poland has a specific form of madness attached to it, which is very interesting to watch as a spectator but as a first-hand guy... This is nothing I'd love to live on. Even if it can be at times worse overseas, it's easier to dodge it and it's not entirely constant. But then one might say my life is mad as it is. And you'd be right.

  This hardly a week passed really fast... Maybe not as fast as the prior days but I certainly was starting to feel as if this short trip was a mistake in the end. Primarily due to just me not being in the right state of mind after all this happening. I couldn't exactly wind down here either but I still in the end managed to enjoy just me managing to do this short after-graduation trip. It's all really twisted but even me being sick n' all, this form of trip each time puts things into perspective which is a very crucial subject. Losing it, tends to derail me as I am. Reacquisition keeps on pushing me further, knowing that Australia or any other place in the world I go to, is not the end and that I always remain, having a handful of options. An environment I ended up building myself and from the perspective, I just see that in the last few years I managed to create an entirely one-of-a-kind experience, entirely not subject and possible to replication and me frankly, not knowing of anyone who had managed to complete something that I've done. This feels like boasting but I tend to lose sight and track of all that has happened and so losing my perspective after all. I know where it's coming from once I get all displayed up-front. But it's usually just obfuscated, which tends to be a good soil for growing deviations of all kinds (which sounds serious but ease off, it's just me not being entirely happy with where I am).

  I'm not entirely sure when I booked my next flight. It was also a bit in the process, I think I've done this in Poland. It took also quite some effort, even getting the tickets to Europe, was hectic and I missed on a few interesting offers in Europe too. In fact, I should have had it as a longer trip, I could've actually but I also had stuff to take care of while in Australia. And then I managed to get myself a ryanair to Thessaloniki, from which I hoped to get a train down to Athens and catch a flight. It was all cool except for the part that the other airport from which these ryanbois depart is two bloody hours away and with my flight scheduled to take off in the morning, I had to wake up around 4 am, to get prepared, finish packing and arrive at the airport around 7. Which I did by not sleeping much at all and finding that my flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. How convenient for the airline carrier I figured, if it was over 3 hours I'd get compensation I figured. So I went around, chilled, had a coffee with my mom who wanted to see me off. And then I learned a bit more about the compenstation thing and I asked the lady what was the reason. Well, the plane had to be changed, so maybe.... Then I read more, turned out it might be tricky and then I got myself through security n' all and the plane did arrive like it said, within the 3 hour period but... it arrived at destination over 3.5 hours later. I filled in for compenstation in Athens, extremely tired at that point... and got the message next day that it got approved, sadly not enough to get the 400 Euros but I did get 250 scheduled... to be sent to my German bank account. Yep, lucky right? The other interesting thing that I come across, that I'm usually seen as quite normal at the airport. Despite me looking like a terrorist on my passport and in real life, I tend to get the more complex treatment only in Australia, while in Poland I'd be addressed in Polish even. That's cool.
</p>

<p>
  Thessaloniki, though. I arrived later than expected which complicated things as I wanted to see a lot in this city. There was a connecting bus from the airport for which we had to wait for a bit, the ticket was incredibly cheap, I think 2 Euros but the bus was pretty much what we paid for, as we hardly managed to squeeze in one with so many people waiting from the ryan we just arrived with. It took a while to get to the center and I didn't even know exactly where was one but I did get to know fast that this city is quite widespread. Eventually, I reached the central station and started feeling a bit eerie and unsafe... Which remained for the next hour. There was a guy shouting at the station at the clerk. The train departure times did not match what was said on the website (with it about to depart later). The people around the station seemed shady, the city itself extremely chaotic and as if having a very Balkan feel to it. There was some persistant guy who kept accosting me for a moment. The first impression was not exactly what I thought it would be. Which transformed into warmer colours as I found the city to be very original, very Balkan but also offering quite a fair bit in terms of what to see. The seaside was quite plain but really nice in terms of how there seemed no end to the horizon... it was also quite busy and there were a lot of tourists and as it would seem, students too. Again, I wanted to see as much as possible which I managed to do and see most of the attractions despite the large terrain I had to cover. The sights were limited to historical areas, some archeological and some fusions that I've kept seeing between cultures like Greek, Christian, Turkish etc. It was really flavorful as much as the food that I got was later on. The city centre felt really cool but cool as the weather was, cooler than 2 weeks ago but still bareable to be around in my current alike originally clothing mix. The more as if shopping/restaurant area had a very pleasant vibe to it, just this distinct feel that a person is after when going visiting as a tourist. Like I said, the city grew on me. I had very limitted time, though so like 2-3 hours and I was back at the station, trying to figure out the platform after having crashed at a cafe, sipping on a Frappe (I was sick, what's wrong with me) and some fresh juices. Eventually, it all turned out just fine, although I was a bit afraid of how it will be in the train as there were many different characters around the station itself. I didn't want to put my eyes to sleep. But eventually I did and it didn't feel like a bad choice either, as there were many people going the same direction and they all seemed local and even friendly between one another. Also the train itself? From the outside, the enitre area and carriages were all covered in graffiti but in the inside, they were comfortable, well maintained and the train, which was quite important, right on time in Athens. I was sad that I didn't get to see much of Greece this way as it did cover quite some area... but maybe some other day and still, this train was significantly cheaper, also I had a student discount. 
</p>

<p>
  Thessaloniki was cool in the end. It grew quite fast on me and there was plenty to see and I could see in the people that it was a fun city to be as well. A bit worn down in some parts but still for just these few hours to was cool to venture around just as I did once I hit back at Athens. I had literally no time here anymore, so I just grabbed like a bagel covered in sesame and a freshly squeezed orange juice, all for an equivalent of really low 1.5 Euros, breakfast of Masters if you could call it. Then I just made my way towards the city centre to just explore a bit how it feels after hours. Really distinct again, now I could focus a bit more on the architecture and the soothed out feel of Athenian streets. Even more at the nature accompanied by them and heck, I even found a place that served some Mexican food and where I could charge my phone (which I really needed!). One thing that I did not mention was that my powerbank broke down. Very unfortunate, as it was a souvenir from Korea. I managed to cover a bit of previous unknown part, the northen, of Athens. Which was, well, vacated at around 4-5 am but still cool. After wandering for a bit, I moved towards Monastiraki which felt radically different now that it was all closed shut. With the Akropolis lit on the hill. And then I bought a ticket, took a final round around, said goodbye and puff, I'm off. Taking a metro to the airport, where I had to repack and bounce to Singapore.
</p>

  <p>As much as I felt this trip was unneeded, a bit impulsive and unnecessary, in the end you could say life is. Maybe that sounds trivial but at some point, I won't be able to do these trips anymore due to the complete lack of time. I know this. And even if I manage to damage stuff in the process, there's no way of knowing until you actually do and of all the unexpectedness, feeling welcome again, in Europe. I think this is one of the priceless that you get to experience in life. Which can tear people but me looking forward, it's also and always nice to think that there are places where you can still feel welcome.
