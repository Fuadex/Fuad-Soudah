      This marks my, weeeelll... I wouldn't say how many days, cities and trips I have done in this country. Although there is this something really strange about Germany that, surprisingly, I have not really experienced with any other country. Usually I can associate one with a general weird course of events that I may summarize in one or two sentences, for Germany it would be - uncertain, unexpected, welcome and sad.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's not really a sentence, is it now? Especially that the unexpected usually did turn out in colours, as in very positive outcome in an unexpected form, as for let's take it: Dusseldorf, which I had visited in the past, I didn't really like it at that time but at this particular time of the year? Oh how beautiful it was?
    </p>

  <center><h4>I decided to make a change</h4></center>
    
  <p>
    How do you like it?
</p>

<p>
    Thought I'd make the layout slightly cleaner, although honestly looking at the structure and looks of the website, I think it's high time to just simply raze it all to the ground. It doesn't end there, though. In all due thought process, I think the razing process should extend to other parts of my life and memories, although completing this process seems much more cumbersome than what the simplicity of razing seems to invoke.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first weeks following my departure from my studies, at least for now called a leave of absense, were actually quite fruitful. I managed to backup lots of data, lose weight, do some stuff I kept postponing for years in fact. But as of pretty much last month, there was barely anything that I was doing, so in fact, I plunged into the well-known to me the state of, well, limbo, oblivion, nothingness, whatever one, you, whomever may call it. The state of stalemate.
  </p>

  <p>
    I often think thought and as often I comeback to my earlier years and contemplate on many things. Random thoughts surface and memories, some crystal vivid as my life form and some fleeting as often I alight the train. I often think of writing all these as I think they're interesting tales to be told but I often withdraw to just simply thinking and knowing that most likely they won't surface at anytime anymore and life will continue for most with not much attention placed on fleeting things like life of my own.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a bit of a tough nut to crack, considering it's all a pandemic wraithing and many people not doing anything even or just doing what they can from home. Somewhat like myself in the very same bandwagon. Except that I am really doing anything and often even nothing and not much of a single thing starts to not bring any sense of joy to me, which starts to solidify into a problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem is as well, that I am running out of things to do. While I'm dieting, I have limited options as to what food I may eat. Spotify in my discover weekly began playing the same music for a while now, so it may seem it ran out of music to widen my own bubble. My father keeps playing the very same shows and music everyday. I'm reading pretty much the very same news, listening to the very next yet samey audiobooks, watching samey shows, movies and playing samey video games. They all are just starting to wash out and gray out, lacking much to offer just as myself.

    One begins to wonder, as all of this continues to be fleeting, months after initially creating this entry. As the world continues to move forwards, I stay the same. Idle. Without an idea as for what I want to do in life anymore. Not really sure why I ended up in this place in the very beginning. Not sure what to do with any of my previous accomplishments as, at the time being shiny and exemplary, today they seem as brittle as a supermarket candy, so shiny at first, so craving at the time, content with how it tastes like, sort of leaving you wanting more and then wondering, what it was all for?
</p>

<p>
  As I feel left alone by the surrounding world, one that I seem to be drifting further apart from, not being able to connect with and be content of the connection anymore, looking back and through the, fairly well documented lifetime as I had, covering the last 6 years of my life, there is lots of thoughts coming through my head, too many, vague and mouldy and all in haze of sorts.
</p>

<p>
  And I'm also wondering whether any of this is actually worth sharing, to the outer world, as these are all dreams that can be presented to the outside world, dreams that some people can associate with, some of them, each and everyone, to some degree or perhaps none at all. Something you need to spend time to dig through. Some to contemplate or...
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps look at the pretty pictures.
</p>

<p>
  Just Pictures.
</p>

<p>
  It's all that's really left after all.

  Beautiful Dreams.

    <center><h4>Cologne</h4></center>

<p>
  And now for a city that we headed, from a city where I withdrew money from a wonderful bank branch of regional savings bank that I still have an account in, a little bit unsettled as kind of convinced without a proper ticket is okay but me knowing that was not okay but yolo anyway, to a city about I knew only that my other friend did not quite like due to not feeling safe but as it all turned out to be quite far from, well, the blank I had in my head and a dire need to go to the toilet for quite sometime, which made sense after the food and beers and the really progressively getting colder weather. Oh, I also forgot to mention we headed into Rossmann, where I got another realization, that heck, this chain of pharmaceutical/chemist stores actually is incredibly cheap! 2.5 Euros for a shampoo? With not that much more expensive other products in-store? Is this heaven? A sort where you can get equipped with literally anything for a price lesser than food? I even got myself a few hairbands as I couldn't find this type for a long time. And later in Cologne, I actually was in dire need of going to the toilet eventually, also due to the exponential amount of beers that we chucked at a very local-feeling and from what I heard from tales type of a German pub, although the tales related to a much further down south-east slavic country of Czech Republic (Czechia?). How it worked, was that it was full... of locals. And we barely scrambled, actually a friend scrambled two seats by two other strangers. At first we received two beers in quite small, kind of tallish, apparently typical beers glasses from Cologne and a beer mat on which the number of beers were being noted. And with each next beer downed, another came faster than you'd realize. Apparently at times, they even hand around homemade food. The place had a really locallish vibe, it was a bit hard to talk with the volume produced by all the people inside but, I guess it's just something that pubs are known for. Instead of going in to actually really talk to people, it's rather a place in which it's perfect to get smashed but it was still better than many pubs I've been to. And the beer was fair.
</p>

<p>
  Then there was a bit of walking, I believe Edeka discovering, getting to know a small part of Cologne after dark and then just crashing due to both of us being just plain tired (and me booking a flight the following morning, I think it was the following morning?). There were two things that I had to get done, well maybe three. Getting myself caffeinated, which I did at a venue recommended by a friend where I got myself as I believe a fine Brasilian aeropress and some tiny but delicious pastries. And I was served by I swear, a pair of Germans with an exceptional English accent. That kind of thing brought me to another realization. How am I still on and off with my own English command. It's not that I don't know it. But to be fair, I do get lost in my Polish too. And then don't get me started with my German, with which I still managed to understand an overwhelming lot, all of which I did not quite expect to quite happen. Then, I needed some extra caffeine from the nearby shop and mineral water and afterwards proceed with pushing through with my final deliverable: research journal, which I intended to submit right on time. For this assessment, I actually received 90%, so I was happy. I made sure it was looking good too. The process after all was quite hectic and bumpy. But anyway once I got that finished, I... what did I do afterwards? Did I move towards the city? I think I moved towards the city and also remained in awe of these absolutely stunning ginkgo trees, which at this time of the year, oh my my, how I was surprised to soon discover, that where I was crashing momentarily, turned out to be likely the most gorgeous location in Cologne, hands down, you don't come across such locations too often.
</p>

<p>
  So, I figured, I'm having a bit of a constrained time here in Cologne as well, so gotta get going while I still have the time, to see what needs to be seen around. And so I decided to make the obvious approach of just walking towards the city and bumping about the main tourist attractions as listed on tripadvisor. That proved... somewhat okay. I think I also took a look at wikitravel and got my hands on some sorts of maps. And this way, I was albo to do the city, at least the western bank of the city where most of the attractions seemed to have been located. And I have discovered... well not too much of the really amazing. I've seen a huge church with really high trees around. A bakery, where I wanted to buy a pair of I believe Marzipan sweets but got some others in form of cupcakes instead (my German has its limits I guess...). And then, the point where my jaw dropped, Cologne's Cathedral. Oh my, oh my. The first words that came to my mind: What the Fuck. I guess that's not just me, I hope the guy who made this didn't go to hell for this. The church from the inside does not seem too impressive but the outside's structure is as gothic as it gets. And massive too. Painstakingly detailed. I'd say one of the more impressive cathedrals in Europe, in terms of its exterior outlook and certainly a centrepoint of Cologne, next to which there was the main train station on one end and a cultural complex with a museum and a weird opera hidden and forbidden to tread on at key times on the other. And a long shopping alley on the other side of it all. There is an industrial-era bridge too in the very vicinity. And so I kind of bounced around and... uh! Then I returned back as my battery was dying by taking a few tram stops on the cheapest tram ticket (as I could do it, just 4 stops away) and voila, not so long after, back at exploring Cologne!

    <center><h4>Tired Culture</h4></center>

<p>
  I don't exactly remember every single detail about what I was doing onwards. Just that I reached the place and soon after my friend reached it too, we were off to the city again. I received an interesting ticket from the friend as I could ride on it anywhere in the nordrhein-westfalen area. And then my google location seems weirdly quiet about my next whereabouts. I think, obviously my phone was out of juice. But as I'm recreating the events in my head, I believe we went by public transport closer to the center, took a stroll and head towards a Jazz Cafe. Yes, that's what happened and the joint was really cool too. The jazz being played was a form of smooth jazz, they would play a set every now and then and get a bit of tips by walking around. Germans were playing the jazz and the area had a very, very cool vibe. Unfortunately, I didn't get my hands on beer and partially due to that but also all of before, I was just tired and on the verge of falling asleep. Not really a good companion at this time, even my research journal killed me, plus I was falling sick and the caffeine I had pumped into my system along with minerals didn't seem to work anymore. And it was getting now really cold... and then what else, what else... ah, my wonderful feet screeching from being constantly flattened for the last few days. I think there might have been even more. And so we left, took a stroll around and I think our next stop was... apart from the river, also... a chocolate market. Oh my, I might have never tasted better chocolate in my life. One pure cacao praline, that was so crumbly and yet so distinct and powerful in its taste that it was mindblowing how good this kind of produce can taste. And you could go around, tasting the flavors coming from all directions, many of them from regional Italian villages from what I established. I also got my hands on... Feuerzangenbowle! A particular form of liquour, strong and in flames when they hand it over, full of spices, mulled wine, strong rum and a sugarcone dropping into the ambrosia. Afterwards, we strolled around a bit and moved on top of a chocolate museum. With a very cool view over the city. Then we started moving back and... dropped by a vintage-looking pub. With vintage philips tvs and vintage menu and vintage everything. This city, just kept on growing on me, as the locations I was being brought to, had an absolute wow-factor through the roof. I think I just got myself a cup of coffee with rum... forgot I had to tip at somepoint. Been really abuzz but still just way too tired to be able to formulate sentences in proper manner. And after trying to discuss about stuff, we went back.
</p>

<p>
  Also, I still could not get ahold of how well I was being treated yet again. Taken everywhere, being tried to be subjected to hospitality of the form that I was expected not to pay for anything and kind of covertly and passively fighting back on that. Just how wonderful the area was and Cologne itself... I didn't mention that just yet but it's because I was focusing on the city, rather than its dwellers. I will throw in a few words in the next blog but just how welcoming and friendly all the people here were... It sounds so, generic. But really, just how people seemed friendly, full of life, complete strangers. A far cry from what my other friend had gathered from her stay in Cologne. I was very impressed by just how pleasant this city was, peaceful and full of life hidden away and around. It was also in a way worn down but it had its nice feel to it too. Dusseldorf upon my first encounter marked quite negative results, with me not feeling safe, seeing homeless taking drugs and just not seeing much here really. Then it all turned and during the Fall, it was a real pleasure to walk around to be frank. And in Cologne? As before, no expectations were attached, just curiosity of what I will discover. And I managed to see a great deal, I'd say a bit more than everything really in the scope of this and following days. The architecture had its German feel. The natural part with trees were at times astonishing. It felt like a hip city, a bit in its form Berliny, at least a bit further in the outskirts. But I'll be continuing with more in the following Blog.
