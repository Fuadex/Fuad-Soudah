  Hiya.
</p>

<p>
	I've got (sort of) a new PC! Newly built, ready to go. What should I install? What should I do?
</p>

<p>
	Oh, right. I mean, I had all of it pre-planned already. So what am I really dwelling on?
</p>

<p>
	A human head is a fantastic device. It's got sort of all you need to live but it all becomes sort of foggy every now and then and especially with time.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking, my computer. Brand new. Back in the day whenever on, I'd know it's on. If not the hard drive, could be the DVD ROM or something else letting me know. You could not really do anything with it, transport or whatever. But now? You barely even hear it, it's a big black box, it keeps whatever you want and can take you wherever you want.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, it's all dependent on what I intend for it to use it on. It's a great convenience to have one. But what if my mind evaporates any complete ideas I'd have and rollback to my old routines?

  First effort I had to make was at the beginning of it all to get all the part ASAP. There were bits of bots of worries but I had a few things on my mind: I got a Windows 10 Education key from my UTS Store and as I was leaving on absence, the account could become void very, very soon along with my keys. I got the parts about a week before expiry, although I guess having taken a screenshot beforehand would've done me a favor anyway (unless Microsoft would block something, you never know, they're not in theory as oppressive a company, one would hope so). Then, it was getting all the software, Adobe Creative Cloud - but that didn't really make much of a difference as I had an account from.. dang it, I have an account from University of Sydney but I also have my private account on a student discount that was sort of frozen after having bought for free from my USYD faculty year-long subscriptions for my private account. Then it was supposed to be 19$ it bounced up to 40$, I was asked to confirm my student status and it got approved (still from usyd at the time) and then I got into customer service and they said they can't physically roll it back to ~~18.5$ but they can to about bit over 20$ as this is the lowest possible. I was, k. So there's that account going to last me until something like January. Then there is the account I bought for about 50$ that is with my USYD login. I might still be able to login with an account from Parsons. And I had free access with my UTS account during the covid stuff happening. Crazy, huh? This software costs money and I barely use it have a couple of account but still have to pay for it. Anyway, I have a Houdini Education licence from ALA lasting until December. I also have Foundry first year free licence until end of May I think. Houdini licence I had to uninstall from my laptop and as for Foundry I had to activate it and bind it to my PC but the key I had kept in my email for a few weeks now so I was getting increasingly worried. To give you context, Houdini costs 550$ a year, which is sort of fine I guess. Adobe CC full costs a lot as well in fact, right now it'd be like 240$ a year I guess on a student account? I have a discounted Office 365 account, Home now, since the student version that was 4 years for about 100$ is no-longer an option sadly. But I still cut down on this a while back to something like 70$ a year. And then there's Foundry which costs bonkers - single softwares can ramp up to 10000 U$, I'm not joking - look at Foundry Nuke or Katana, I was really hardboiled to get this. I got ToonBoom which is sort of UTS ADP exclusive but open for all UTS students for a year and I also renewed my Autodesk acccount to get my Maya and other stuff goodies. I think that's about it? Oh, also Substance, good to have that too.
</p>

<p>
	That's a lot of software Fuad but why not pirate it all?
</p>

<p>
	Well, a while back I decided that whenever I can go legal, I probably should, yet still trying to go as low as possible even if at the expense of being sort of on the borderline of the law. Sometimes it's grey area but I can't say I'd be bending it in many cases. Look at this in such way, sure, I'm no student discounts and student trials even despite I'm kind of technically a student and not a student. But am I really a culprit? I know of folks who'd be going some really dodgy ways in life and getting ahold of packs of software on education licences that were obtained through legitimate routes, shouldn't be frowned upon - especially since I'm not yet in the professional state. And, of course, still some prefer to go pirating but I feel it kind of dodges a bit the idea of learning and becoming a full professional. That sentence doesn't make entirely sense but it still sort of does I feel in its own way.

    <center><h4>Backing Up</h4></center>

<p>
  One of the things I intended on doing was going down the memory lane and sorting out all the photos and videos and 360 material and everything I've been hoarding on different drives, clouds n' stuff throughout the years. Now it was the perfect opportunity, even if my 3TB MyCloud was starting to refuse to cooperate, bloody freakin' thing, first time a drive is failing on me. Can't ever trust those fuckers. Here's the complete (I hope) picture: throughout the years, I was hoarding all my stuff across primarily a few devices: Surface Pro 3 (~250 GB), Surface Book 2 (~500 GB), old PC (~250 GB), older Poland PC (~2TB), old external HDD (~2TB), older external HDD (~250 GB), external cloud HDD (~3TB), external SSD (~1TB), Book microsd (~500 GB) and a couple of microsd cards ranging from 32 GB to 256 GB for my DSLR and Gear 360 camera as well as my smartphone, a few of which came through: Galaxy S2 (~64 GB), Galaxy Note 3 (~64 GB ?), Galaxy S7 (~64 GB?). You think that's it? Pf. Now come the clouds, most of which I hoarded on Microsoft Onedrive: Primary account (1 TB), secondary account (1 TB), USYD uni account (1 TB). Trust me, I maxed all of 'em out. + I have access to many others, at UTS, KAIST, Parsons. Used to to LMU. Sometimes you'd get to different emails like at KAIST or UTS, then you'd get access to two different onedrives. Also Google drive personal (about 20 GB), Parsons GDrive (unlimitted), UTS GDrive (also looks unlimitted). The thing was that much of this was all around and in some duplicates. I've already been sorting through some of the stuff ever since I got myself an 8 TB Hard Drive for 200$, it was a good deal from amazon, import from US. And the same went for the newer external SSD or microsd, which was quite an expense to bear while I was in the US (microsd) but it greatly helped with the chaos I had on my laptop. Ever since receiving the 8 TB, I managed to put actually everything on it, at least that was key: Surface Pro 3 data, Surface Book 2 data from the first one I had and the two replacements, with the latter being fully backed up, even with system files (the hell I need them for?). The small HDD and 2TB HDD also landed up there along with the external SSD, my PC's 2 TB and 250 GB and microsd + some phone and onedrive data. This didn't manage to fill it up totally with 1.7 TB remaining but like I mentioned, some stuff converged, some stuff was missing and so I had to do some renovations.
</p>

<p>
	On one hand I had to try reviving my 3 TB MyCloud. I did that later, basically it kind of keeps failing after 5 minutes and I managed to copy across, rather, key stuff, most of it newer. Mostly it harbours, hehe, gray stuff like video games, tv shows and movies. The thing is, that I kind of don't need any of this as most games I actually already own on steam or other platforms, most movies are in dire quality and tv shows, once watched, I don't plan on getting back to them + I have Netflix and Amazon Prime with VPN support (hopefully this will still continue for now). Of course it's not an ideal situation to lose lots of this data but after looking through much I needed, I am happy to say that particular disk is frankly quite redudant to me. And at this stage I have to point out that I think messing with this messed up my windows as Explorer would continuously refuse to refresh on any change I made like copy a file to the same location. Unnerving situation, I kept on looking for solutions for a few hours in fact, resetting icons, folder options, changing registry keys. At one point I got so angry I decided to do a system refresh from pendrive which... didn't end up fixing my issue. Only rolling back the system managed to get this done, funnily, it rolled back to one of the newest, July releases of Windows. Then I managed to find out that the network folders remained somewhere in my Explorer, which would at times not show anything and in fact it would all turn to shit as I stumbled into Microsoft Photos Settings, which crashed, at which program totally did not get anything from Onedrive which got me exceptionally angry (stuff very recent, 25th of July, I was sorting through Photos earlier than this to which I'll connect later on). Now everything seems in order but damn, Microsoft, fix you damn system, I know that perhaps Networking settings can do weird stuff but for fucks sake! After reinstalling through weird links Microsoft Photos and Onedrive damn it... I hope that's all of it and I won't have to do any more shit like this.
</p>

<p>
	Now! Photos! So the thing was, that much of the backup was already stored on the 2 TB Drive, which I updated a while back. Some of it was on the old PC's HDD and some were even in the 250 old HDD. All I had to do was pretty much check integrity between each folders, which I did folder by folder. The issue was that the naming convention was a bit broken so I had to fix this up at a later stage. Lots of the RAW files were exclusively harboured on onedrive, which was a bad idea but the only option looking years back to like 2015-2017. That having said, I had a massive backup that looks back even prior to 2014, my high school and primary school years with quite a lot of stuff packed in it, which also had some minor differences and I decided to merge these along. Then there were some key holes, again, some folders for some reason were only backed up on a second Onedrive and I had to redownload them repeatedly as Onedrive sometimes just stops downloads for no reason whatsoever. Again, cloud issues. This took I think about two days sorting through all the stuff and there were even some 360 photos backed up in some folders and some smartphone photos and videos, chaos man! And now time for a short from facebook:
</p>

<p>
	At this time of the year I'd normally be travelling. Yet since Australia in all its nanny state wisdom bars its citizens from leaving indefinitely (and barely lets even its own citizens in and if so, with hefty price tags attached: 3k for mandatory hotel, who knows how much for hopefully uncancelled flights in), with covid performing its comeback encore right around my neighbouring local districts and a sudden burst of free time that fell onto my lap, I guess the most travelling I'll be doing is down the memory lanes of my past couple of years. I guess I shouldn't complain, by far I'm in a good spot. And I've been long meaning to go through, what looks like 1.14 TB of photos, which I spent sorting through and patching up from scattered offline and online backups. That's over 46000 RAW files. And there's an additional 43000 (577 GB) of mixed smartphone photos/videos, 629 GB of 360 videos/photos on top of all this... I feel like I'll have quite a ride. As for any physical rides, I'm hoping not too close till the end of the year will start opening up some windows to squeeze through.

    One thought I had for quite some time now was to get all these RAW photos merged with my Onedrive cloud on PC. The cool thing about Windows and (Personal) Onedrive these days is that all the automatically backed up photos and even all the photos and videos scattered across your cloud can be kept there and Photos app can scan by itself what's on it and display thumbnails without downloading any of it, until you actually select one of them. Couple of issues: cloud, as in singular, you can't connect multiple personal Onedrives - so I had to stick to the 1 TB limit, really painful for me at the time as I had to start moving my RAWs to another drive and do cleaning a while back. Secondly, the photos if opened, at first are pixelated as Photos needs to download them. All in all it's a super convenience but not a perfect one. But what if you add your entire 1.25 TB collection from your drive to Photos folder? And here began magical things to happen.
  </p>

  <p>
  	At first it was beautiful, I looked back very far and I could see amazing things, a complete picture of all my DSLR pictures and everything, really, everything in there. The duplicates were not shown as Photos takes care of this as well. But when I moved back, like really back, I noticed peculiar things happening with the dates. One day I was in Netherlands, the other I was in Germany. What the hell? I noticed that the date taken did not correspond well at times with Date created and Date modified, at times with all having a different date. This fucked everything on my timeline, creating chaos not just in Photos or my folder but in my head. And that wasn't cool. I decided to get it all out and get rid of the folder then. Cause, mate, I need some clean timeline and the photos backed up from my smartphone looked solid. Don't believe in clouds kids, they're cool but not always. Weird shit sometimes comes hailing down. And then I also noticed that by adding this to Photos, the folder from my external drive, Photos decided to take upon itself to start getting the HDD: Indexed, defragmented and all sorts of weird shit, which would keep it running practically all the time and turn it up at random times. That would be fine, except, that it's the loudest part, even if external, of my PC. Take note of this, how quiet my PC actually is, when I get triggered by a repeated cyclical, even if quite rare, quiet click in it. It took me a long time to figure out how to get it civilised through some really burried power options in computer management under USB energy preservation options. Took me way too much time and effort spent in this. At any rate, I still have the entire DSLR history sorted now on my drive along with Gear 360 photos and videos sorted into episodes that I also plan on going through and a quite big history of photos, that I have readily available through Microsoft photos and if something doesn't stick, I also have all this, at least lots of it on my 8 TB Drive.
  </p>

  <p>
  	The other thing is, well, whether I actually want to do all the colouring on my old monitor. And that's something I was thinking about. I have no reason to believe that it wouldn't be better to use my laptop which is, I believe, 100% sRGB and even a 3:2 aspect ratio perfect for working with photos. But the monitor I have has an interesting contrast ratio, which should help maintain a solid brightness level all across the photos. It also surprisingly handles better grays, which bands on my Surface Book 2 (I blame intel actually) and also my Book 2 has some colour retention happening, or colour burn, can't say for sure but it might affect how I post-process photos. As for the 360 material, most of this I will actually have to go through, as in, post-process on my phone, which is sort of ready with its massive 256 GB large storage. The battery life of Gear 360 might become an issue, though. I might also have to do lots of stabilisation through Adobe After Effects and to consider the amount of files I will have to go through... but I had a great rig with a beast CPU so that's great. What else is left I wonder? Well, going through my old blogs and stitching it all up, this will be lots of work and retrospective work especially. There are many blanks but I will have to just trust my head and whether my writing-style also reflects well what I was going through and aiming for and all of this stuff. It's a great privilage... privilage? Well, I guess makes me happy seeing that I can actually get all this done now and create something very unique and interesting based on, I believe, a unique journey of last years.

    <center><h4>A little more</h4></center>

	<p>
    Before I go any further, I think I still have some backups to do. I'm looking at ALA, where I still had lots of stuff harboured on my sandbox and local machine. It's nice to see that I still had access to this and even my computer. I wonder how long will I still have access to my UTS account, so I kind of need to move fast to get stuff across. The same goes for my Parsons data and possible USYD data, who knows how much longer all this will linger. And I've got lots of space to accustom + the covid help from my favourite broadband company Aussie Broadband which provides free transfer between 8-6 daily, of which I am quite abundantly making use. From what it looks like, it's not hurting Aussie much either, that's why they continue to provide this for their customers since like May. In case of Parsons there isn't much actually, just perhaps my mocap files which are really heavy, I think they weigh over 200 GB or so. In case my USYD onedrive, this may be a bit more complicated but I'll continue to investigate.
  </p>

  <p>
  	You may wonder, why on earth would I be hoarding such an immense amount of data. I think I explained it a little, could be that I'd need to elaborate on this, as the reason is simple - I'd like to save and make a better use of my past experiences and just simply make sure the investment I've made becomes an actual contribution to my life. Feels a bit materialistic if I put it this way but in the end, anything a person does should sort of already contribute in one way or another to one's life. The very same thing really works in my terms. To clarify this a bit further, I guess if I'm hoarding that much data, that'd mean I also hoard actual physical stuff and the same reasoning should transfer onto such? Yes and no. Say, the old PC is in my drawer and so are ping pong rackets I bought off a friend a few years back and I think all my past smartphones. But if you look at this, I don't really acquire things I don't need. Due to my financial situation and being a student, I like free shit and if there's a way to make my life better, I usually aim to just do so. But I do so after heavy deliberation, weighing pros and cons as in at least a few circumstances I burnt myself needlessly by taking rash decisions. From little things like my very old external HDD which was added as a "FREE ITEM" if bought along with a laptop, which I've chosen for my mom at the time. It wasn't a bad laptop. But looking back, there were better suited choices for her. I don't really have an army of clothes, although today I have a fairly complete pack compared to years prior, when one or max two pairs of pants could've suited my needs perfectly, with an extra tracksuits to parade along my four corners. Usually I'd aim for good stuff at discounted prices and try to hoard a few more items if I was sure it'd be a good investment, as a result, I have T-shirts in my wardrobe that were quite frequently worn by me that are even over 2 years old. They have some holes in them but I still like wearing them. That having said, there are items I probably should get rid of that I don't really associate much with like short pants with holes in them, which I've thrown at a corner somewhere. A different story is with my tshirts that have stuff written on them, like from KAIST, while I do not really wear those, I'm sorta starting to but only to parade again within my own four corners. And if I could, I'd grab one thing to suit me in different circumstances - my laptop is a great example, it's a laptop, it's a tablet, it works long and in many different circumstances, I can play games on it even - it's great, it substituted any of my needs for a new computer that had nothing changed in it for 5 years. Well, until I figured it's time to get something that could save time and serve as an investment.

  	I guess I might have some relation to perhaps the Japanese or Scandinavians, in which just not having too much shit actually makes me feel better. Sort of a minimal yet conscious and sort of sustainable lifestyle. But sometimes I wonder if it's actually right going this way. As I do invest in food too, a bit too much in fact. And many times it's a very messy lifestyle as I'd pour money into sweets which are heavy in calories and cost money. And in fact I'd feel the only time I really eat healthily is when I'm on a keto diet, which is still a bit short on protein but much healthier as I'd eat meat and veggies, with fat becoming fuel in my case as per the diet's nature. Such pondering comes and goes, more or less frequently and it usually requires further dwelling on the matter to get it anywhere close towards a probable resolution.

  	But if you think about it, it kind of all makes sense. As even if you sort out some things in life or hard drive, it doesn't necessarily mean that there still ain't a mess around and once you start sorting through this, some may be moved around, misplaced etc. It's an entire process that may not be of liking, cause you're getting somewhere by doing all this but is this really what you want to be doing right at that very time? And again, pondering.

   I did a bit more cleaning. This time I went through what I had on one of my wardrobes that I use as a place to chuck stuff in and forget about, thinking, that one day I might come back to this. It's kinda cute. There was also so much dust for me to clean up, so so much. I found a number of microUSB cables and chargers, more than I thought I had in possession. There were also some old Audiotechnica ATX-M40x cables. These were cool headphones until they broke up. They still worked and I kept patching them up, until the small cable connecting the headband (?) got damaged on one end but it still worked. Until I got these headphones to the states and had to try patching up again. The first things to go, though, were a pair of cables: primary and secondary. There was nothing exactly wrong with both actually, except, that they got bent. First time, I think my Surface Pro 3 fell down, crazy hard fella, instead of breaking, my cable input just bent. The other cable had a similar story that I can't recall. In any case, both were bent but it was the travel and security checks right into the US that got them good, at least one of the cups. I kept these around for a very long time once I got back until I decided to check whether I could get them repaired at an expense, of course. I left them at the repair place and got an email that, you know what, this doesn't make sense to repair, we're just gonna give you 40% off any AT headphones we've got in-store, how about this? I still asked how much would it cost and it turned out it'd be like buying another pair, as it totalled at +120$ out of which 55$ was labour, it's great to be living in Australia eh? In the end I did a trip to minidisc to try out different headphones and I found out that the M40x do not sound out there as good as I remembered. And M50x Bluetooth sound bit different even if plugged in compared to M50x. And after listening for a while to one and the other and other models I had a feeling my hearing was continuously adjusting which is a feeling I had for quite sometime after having gone through a number of headphones. Well, headphones, the other one before was Sony MDR-V6, which was so neutral that it practically didn't have any bass. I only realised this after getting into M40x. It's an interesting journey to find out how your hearing can continuously change and adjust to be somewhat in.. what your hearing wants to or brain reads from? In the end I settled for Audiotechnica R70x and I use them to this day. The 3 meter cable is a bit of a hassle but they sound phenomenal, exceptional detail, unbeliveably light and the 3 meter cable is actually not that super bad in fact. Very high impendence but my laptop, PC and my FIIO BTR3 for Bluetooth listening (which is a majestic tool, best that I've found by far).

  	But I've found a few more things. A pair of AKG USB-C earphones from Samsung that came with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. I chucked them away as I didn't feel like listening from USB-C, although I heard they were good. I gave them a listen. And in fact, they're not really bad, quite bassy but also fairly warm, very nice signature, imaging and detail, especially for earphones that come as a package. I figure they won't do anyway, even my dad's phone is still on microUSB and I have probably a few chargers I could pass on. I also found a pair of Custom Art CIEMs, which are custom molded IEMs for any of your unfamiliar. These I got still while I was in Germany. And it was like heaven, the isolation, perfect fit and detail. Well, until a cable broke or two for which I received replacements (and for one that I didn't and bought one extra at some point). I also played around with a BT cable that I hated due to everything from Hong Kong (can't recall the company), tried one BT cable that I disliked due to recessed signature (really, you can hear differences in cables, I know it's crazy), I tested one 2-pin cable that I liked for the detail but eventually I went with the standard one I had but... in the end I had issues with my right ear to the point I could not wear these anymore (it really hurt at times). So I got myself a discounted Etymotics ER4XR which had an even better isolation and awesome detail, imaging and overall quality but something is up with the cable and I will have to get them replaced, good they're covered by 2-year long warranty but damn, for future-sake I need cables and these are expensive usually (even 100$). Back back before I was also ramping up on IEMs, I think I started from whatever I had bundled, went up to some Philips, then soundmagic and philips again Fidelio S2 for which I received a refund due to damage right into my German account at the time. Then came Custom Art, which lasted much longer than 0.5 year, in fact, they still play but in the end I also noticed something happening to them: left CIEM plays less bass, there are some cracks on the shells (so I'll need an expensive reshell about 150$) and you know I didn't even hear the difference between the left and right CIEMs. Just at times. Just how interesting that hearing can adjust so much...

  	Good stuff. Kinda shows how I actually have more stuff than I need. And I have a PC and I thought, what if I could also do skype calls? Well, I don't have either a camera or a microphone... Or wait, I have an Intel D435, quite expensive to be simply a camera as it's a volumetric camera but will do (although no Windows Hello). What about the mic, though? And here're issues. I guess I'll need to use of the IEMs I have at hand or FIIO BTR3 but this doesn't seem to work when plugged in as a microphone. Perhaps I could use my Custom Arts FIBAE1? Well, no, if I plug it into my headphone I/O I don't get any microphone output. Putting it into the microphone input? Something happens but really no output. Hmm... What if I plug in my USB-C AKG? Now these work! Hooray, I can use my PC for skype stuff now, how cool is that?! And this way by looking for random shit, I managed to find some cool stuff that I can actually make use of. And my desk is also quite surprisingly clean now.

  	And then there is my Gear360. I have been doing lots of recordings in past years but the thing was I couldn't really make much use of them for a few reasons. One, the battery life of my Gear 360 did not let me do everything... well, it did let me a lot. But getting the files stitched was a huge effort. On PC, the ActionDirection would cut quality which I hated. On phone you could get everything the way it should be, no quality cuts, if you disabled stabilisation you wouldn't get all the errors and stuff. Just the way the material should be but! My galaxy S7 could not really process more than a few movies at one time without depleting all its battery. In addition, its space would go up in the air very very fast and I could only use my phone's storage instead of my microsd. So it remained a balancing act, in which case I decided to not balance at all. Just once I received my Note 10+ I realised that now I have both: the battery, performance (it definitely stitches up material much faster) and space (256 GB!), so despite the enormous space of my movies, I can still get lots stitched up even if after completing the stitching the damn files double in size. But why should I care anymore? I have a feeling my remaining 1.35 TB will also go up in air in my backup HDD. Atm 160 GB being copied of mocap stuff.
