      Oh man, how much I don't want to do all this. I feel there must be something in the background telling me something about the chronic echo rumbling in my ears, clearly not loud enough, of how much I don't feel like doing much at all, for instance, in case of writing up on this journey but also the same case preceding the journey. The problem is, that once it happens, then it eventually does take off. The usual day for me is the usual bombardment of stimuli but after experiencing them over and over, they kind of numb you down and out. Once I get bombarded with a set of something truly new and unique, I get the opposite reaction and it maintains over the course of my journey and a bit afterwards, until it's all back to business, or something worse happens.
</p>

<p>
	In my case it was the latter but hey, everyone starts somewhere and carries out their own personal journeys. It's kind of an everybody's cliche.

    <p>
      I'm not sure if I've already mentioned this but this time, I kind of did a bit more research than usual. Not as thorough due to lack of time but I equipped myself with a massive amount of resources, primarily wikitravel but also some extra google travel resources, which came in handy a notch later in my journey. The impossible thing at the start is to really drill into your brain your routes, usually I do this last-minute. But at the start of it all, you're not really in the moment yet. Hence, I did pre-plan to take it easy. So, accommodation for the first few days so that I don't really flatline, especially my feet which are the most vulnerable. But it still felt like a tricky matter especially once I found my way to Bali. Of course I had prepared a couple of things beforehand, so some currency just in case it was better to exchange money on the spot. It's kind of interesting once I throw myself back to Poland, how every single store technically was equipped with a contactless for of payment, paypass, paywave or whatever the acronyms, already like over 5 years ago and I think even much longer before that, if not looking a decade back. But there are still many regions in the world that do not necessarily skip that far ahead and in the end, prefer the hard currency.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, by taking it easy, I booked a flight departing later on given day. I had several printouts of insurance and flight documents. And I just did the usual, *poof*, at the airport. A pushed back my departure to the airport a little later, since my flight was delayed and still it turned out I had some unresolved things left on my phone. If I was a bit more organised, I likely would have sorted it out days prior but boy oh boy, that's just me.
</p>

<p>
	At this stage I was like. You know what? I could probably make an attempt at translating all my flights into a post after post after another. But to confuse you and perhaps even me, myself and I, still I think it could be enjoyable to write in a bit off-beat style. Touching upon bits of my travels, showcasing some logic, parallels and such. In the end, I was in lots of places on a daily basis. Covered about 25 km per day by my feet. Hell, let's do this!

      Still, first Bali. Ah, you know Bali. For those, who don't necessarily - y'all probably ain't kangaroos from Aussie. Yeah, you'd be surprised, apparently there are kangaroos outside Australia. Obviously exported. And they don't necessarily live in friged but skip around freely on grasslands! Or indoors, idk.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Right, back to Bali! This journey was booked by jetstar. There were many carriers that I involved in this one. I tried to withhold from booking with some carriers like AirAsia due to them charging additional $$ for no reason at all. Oh, we'll charge you 4$ extra per flight, cause, yeah, stop us. Fortunately, there were other carriers and many were fairly local. Citilink Indonesia, which seems to be a low-cost carrier of Garuda Indonesia. JC Cambodia and they have a couple more actually. HK Express, VietJet, Cebu Pacific, Smile Airways subsidiary of Thai, Vietnam Airlines and Scoot. Hm, I think there were more. I think I covered the bit with airlines a while back but, long story short - they were cheap, there were not many alternatives, even on the same day and some would surprise me with extra charges like HK airlines. One problem I expected would be what to say once I approach the airport counter. So many times I could've been refused of going further due to, oh I don't know, like, visa-related etc. But fortunately for most destinations, I could just say: 'Oh I'm transiting here' and if they had some reservations in case of what next, I'd just show them my google maps itenerary. Yes, technology nowadays, it can become actually inexorably useful. The incoming passenger declarations would be tricky to deal with at times, as most would ask for the address of where I'd be staying. Some would be crazy detailed, I can't recall exact details that bewildered me but I think in some cases, they would go to such depth as to retrieving really sensitive details. Like, your employer details. The hell am I supposed to say if my occupation is - a student? As for accommodation, I'd usually put down my next flight number and it would be fine for most encounters. Sometimes I'd be asked about this and I'd just reply I'm transiting and that would be enough.
    </p>

    <p>
    	In case of Bali, it was quite straightforward. Due to my plane's delay, I started thinking about whether same could happen to other airplanes. The thing about air transport is that it's quite reliable, at least that's the ubiquitous knowledge that anyone would share. Of course, I'd just double check the airports in SEA but the interesting thing is, that for some airports around this region, even if they were departing from the capital (or recent) capital city, it wouldn't have many departures. Which meant, essentially, that hey, what kind of delays could you be facing? The two other encounters were pretty much in Cambodia and in Vietnam. First was weird, as the departure time was pushed back by over 2 hours and that was a problem, it meant I wouldn't have that much time after all in Siem Reap. In Vietnam, it potentially meant that I could have a problem getting to Singapore, as something apparently happened to the airplane. The first case was resolved quickly, I mean, resolved, I just got to the airport later which was a slight relief as it was so early but obviously I had other worries. The other, got resolved within an hour, although the handling felt unprofessional, as we were driven around in a bus back to the departure hall and then, we weren't really processed back to another bus which took us to another airplane. Perhaps these are the procedures, can't tell. Oh, also in Sydney, I think there was a guy refused boarding, I think due to him being 'not fit to travel', perhaps too much liquour. Man, should've done it on the spot!

Let's see. I got to Bali. Quite late which started to get me a bit worried, especially since I didn't do the good think to notify the place I was staying at. In the end, usually it's the hotel/hostel/whatever which writes to you first and using booking, it's usually as straightforward as almost a messaging app, that kind of works even by you replying to emails that kind of work on top of the app. It's kind of smart if you think about it, everyone uses an email nowadays, right? Once I got off, I realised the airport was fairly small. I had to write my incoming passenger slip but the problem was, that no pens were around to use. Sometimes I assume they just take them in the evening, perhaps they all were out and they threw them away or perhaps people just took them, for some reasons that would be beyond me. In such cases, people ask other people. I asked some guy working at the airport and I got my think filled out on the spot. Sometimes it's even weirded than this, as such incoming passenger passes are not even available before you're about to roll in through immigration. Sometimes they split them apart, that you have to hand them over after the immigration takes place, which gets some people confused. So the cards are available after you clear immigration and then you can fill whatever needs to be filled and handed over to the officials, who may tell you go ahead or redirect you somewhere else. The interesting thing I found was that in most of the airport, the security was fairly lax. In Australia, it's rather really common that you'll get your luggage checked thoroughly. There were no sniffer dogs or whatever things employed to make sure nothing illegal passes through. The heaviest on this were technically... Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. At KLIA (Kuala Lumpur) you go sometimes even through multiple security checks, when transiting (and again to get to another gate and sometimes even another time if you're departing to some areas like Australia) and in Bangkok it's literally, everything needs to be out that could contain something ferrous. Sometimes your belt will not be picked up, sometimes it will. Sometimes if there were multiple security checks, the same item that did get through such as shoes, would not get through the second time. It's really a rather complex issue, it's just that it gets me thinking, how do they really manage potential drug problems with lax security at some places. Death Penalty probably does enough to deter possible leaks.
</p>

<p>
	The airport on Bali was interesting. Split technically into two, International and Domestic arrivals/departures. I think part of it is being renovated and that'd be domestic. Signs at airports are not usually as straightforward as one could ask for. For instance getting out of Bali was a bit of a maze as in many airports around this region, you'll need to present a ticket to get into the terminal. Probably to deter taxi drivers from peskering tourists. Which they still do while you're leaving the airport, at least the official employees of some, probably, more reputable companies. My problem was with 'where the hell do I withdraw money'. And in the end, I managed to do this still in the arrival area before getting out of the 'official' part of it. The problem I had, was, that seeing the name of the bank on one side and seeing the atms with a different name contrary to the bank's name, started raising some alarms in my head. The atms turned out to be legit, although they'd spit out the massive notes, which could make you feel like a millionaire but heck, it's still a landmine cause you'll need to change those to smaller notes eventually.
</p>

<p>
	I had twice the issue, first on Bali, then in Ho Chi Minh that I wouldn't get change if I tried to pay with currency. I'd be told that I'd get the change the next day once leaving my accommodation, which was naturally a no from me. Good thing you can still use your card, although at a surcharge and you need to use your card, not like samsung pay even if it's with MST (I tried.). I still don't feel quite safe with using such a method but most of the time, it's relatively safe and citibank is at times even too sensitive about certain transactions I make. In the end, obviously, I feel the safest about using my phone to pay for stuff. It may still look suspicious in certain areas around the world, though. Even in the more civilised parts, like Germany.

    	When I was leaving the immigration area, again, 'official employees' peskering you for taxi. And then you realise, that it's so hot and humid outside and there is an army of people waiting, which I could not quite understand at first. So many. So many people, as if there was someone important coming or some flights got cancelled. I think I've never seen so many people waiting outside of arrivals hall. In any case, I had a fairly straightforward job to do, as my place was just about 15 minutes by foot away. I did this on purpose, as my departure flight would be early in the morning so I needed something really closeby. And hell I felt a bit as if I hit some other bulls eye.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The airport I was leaving was essentially built to resemble a temple. A few others in the region are kind of done in a similar fashion, let's see... Siem Reap's airport and Luang Prabang. Most others are palaces made of steel and glass. Not on Bali, where you had a hotel which authentically looked like a temple, positioned right in between domestic and international departures. This could already give a glimpse at the reality I was about to discover on the spot, which is, that this island, Bali, is a paradise but more for fortune seekers. Now, the question is, what format of fortune seekers are we talking about? Centuries ago, it would be foreign empires, here - the Dutch, who'd be seeking riches and violently installing their own reign. Balisians apparently are quite proud of being Balisians and they in fact are a bit different from mainland (?), (can I call it mainland? No? ok...), let's say Javasian Indonesia. They eat pork, they have their own beliefs, shrines, customs. So once they saw a foreign empire coming and trying to install themselves, which they successfully did eventually, Balisians would take to arms and do what they could. And if they couldn't, they would launch themselves straight to death, knowingly. Something that apparently shocked the Dutch and they tried doing something later on to keep Balisian Balisian or something. In any case, today, it's more like: Foreigners coming to Bali to seek the natural riches. And the locals, in many cases, Javanese immigrating to Bali but also Balisians ripping off Foreigners and skyrocketing prices to keep Bali Balisian. Indonesia Indonesian? Idk, see here's the problem, you arrive at a place that is supposed to be a paradise but instead, you're being treated like an ATM Machine and I feel that if ATM Machines had feelings, they wouldn't necessarily be happy about being used predominantly to get machine spit out of them on every step they make.

    	That's the case when you're leaving the airport even still on the official side. Then outside, you're being peskered more, although considering the late time I arrived, it wasn't too bad. But the next day, walking around Kuta is just plain annoying, with every third person you encounter on the street, asking you 'Taxi?', showing a gesture of a steering wheel being turned and regular Taxis just plainly honking at you, as if you're going to be convinced by their honking to give you a lift. It's insane and rattles your head to the point of driving you insane. You don't want to have earphones plugged into your head, because you want to experience the everyday life and you do but of a tourist resort that got pushed to extremes. This was a very dissapointing first encounter with South East Asia but the following weren't as bad. In many cases afterwards, you'd be peskered and not so much even just while leaving the airport. Outside, it'd be fine and that was the case for literally every single destination other than Bali. Bali also doesn't quite have a form of public transport so it makes it even worse for anyone that hasn't got a decent driver at hand. And if you'd like to go anyplace that is a bit Balinese nicer grade? You'll need to prepare yourself for quite hefty expenses, cause Taxi drivers are known to assault Uber-like app drivers. Anyone using Grab will have a hard time here and it's almost like a ninja operation, all Grab drivers had their face covered.

     I tried to get to Ubud in fact the next day, so for this I'd try the first time using Grab app. All potential drivers tried to negotiate and they'd go even far off the listed price. This got me quite freightened, mildly, at the beginning of this huge journey. What if it's all the regions around which overcharge y'all? And do stuff they kinda are not supposed to?
