  A-ha! Spec Ops Man is back! This comeback was a bit painful one and I'm not just speaking of my punctured eardrum. As funny ears may be, they do fix themselves up really fast actually. I was very surprised by how a day not even two have passed and the ears were up and running. just properly should I say as well.</p>

  <p>
    I had a few other remaining things, though. My first and foremost thing that got me actually down under - education! And so I had to embark onto my, potentially, last or semi-last semester at University of Sydney, doing a unique unit of study called Inventing The Future. This would have served as a pretty interesting comeback, as I would get to experience one of the probably most interesting units I'd be undertaking back home, of all.
  </p>

        <p>
      As I returned, I realised there were quite a few things I had to take care of. Most of them were really relevant to government-related agencies, as back in Australia I am unfortunately bound to them. As funny as it may sound and disastrous, while you're reading this, taking into account all the traveling I have done up to date, in Australia, I have been primarily living off the sole gesture and courtesy of Australias Social Services system. It's not that I like being on this, it feels like a prison for much of the time but until someone will eventually be willing for me to do specific jobs for money, it seems that my unforeseen future is bound to this, in conjunction with whatever scholarships may drop in the process, which primarily were the case whenever I would march out into the world on exchange. This time, though, it was much about restoring much of what I left behind so: the sole thing that I am back and whatever was related to this, so I could carry on, still with a chance of taking a bite of the future. Which, unfortunate, due to all my previous endevours undertaken, remained uncertain and very much unforeseen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The thing about being back, though. Eventually all seemed to have fallen in place and what I had to concentrate on, was pretty much my educational journey and so, studies. I decided to take on a bit of a feat this time as I took on this Inventing The Future unit but I did so by taking it in a co-curricular nature. That meant, that in theory I would be taking it but as a 0CP unit, so it would land on my transcript but this created a problem of its own, that I'd be doing this as the only unit of study. That meant, that it's as if I was not studying at all, which wasn't quite true. The faculty services would realise this later in the semester, saying that I have to suspend my studies, otherwise my enrolment would lapse altogether. And after exchanging several emails with this vile institution, I would receive no further response. Very likely due to the fact, that they don't even know what to do. Considering I am taking one of USYD's flagship courses that was available upon competitive entry and by application only. And I am definitely taking it but nobody knew what was going on. The people who are supposed to know what is going on - Faculty Services especially. So usually, whenever this USYD Agency realises that someone fucked up on their side, their answer is to not provide any answers at all. They're extremely fast, though, whenever they're to sack someone. The idea in place, was, that I'd go on a short-term exchange. But that would not happen due to the exchange destination course not being at postgraduate level, which did not hold back the exchange office from sending me to KAIST on exchange at undergraduate level (still, it was 'postgraduate research' but I didn't do this one, despite a friend of mine did actually postgraduate course, as I should have). And so I was enclosed in a bit of a limbo this semester, as I had to finish something, that I'd be doing, kind of for fun actually. Seeing how my skills would apply in this particular case.
    </p>

    <p>
      How did it all turn out? Well, let's start from the beginning while I was still near Warsaw. Trying to figure out my options and feeling all out of them. With my family enclosing me, as if entrapping but not exactly in the end. The feel was certainly there, this patronisation and being, trying to be overly family-like. My short-term exchange in Finland did not come to fruition, again, due to Faculty Services fucking up, as they 'didn't know', I could do my remaining 6CP anywhere in the world. I'd say this was a problem on my end too, as I could've applied earlier if only I wasn't burried in work in New York. And, honestly, they also rejected my application to on exchange in New York. But they quickly fixed this mish-up upon my firm, short email back. Which they didn't fix in terms of the short-term exchange in Finland. Eh... Well, I figured, I could continue somehow back in Australia. I sent out a couple of emails with the stuff I'd done at Parsons and only one person would get back to me and that would be the guy who knew me from the very beginning when I started my studies here in Australia, Martin. He said that perhaps I'd be interested in this course, he sent me a flyer, he liked this Reflection project the most and eventually I applied at the last day in fact. The application was approved and as usual, I wasn't sure whether it would get through but it did. And I attended my first lecture remotely and said I'd be for the next one which was scheduled fortnight later, as the lectures were being delivered fortnightly. The first lecture I attended, I felt I attended in a weird way, just because I was still feeling Parsons effect on me and I was just simply tired. But also tired of being in Poland. So, the lecture went. But my introduction was likely confusing.

      In the end, as I'd discover, there were not that many people in the course. It was pretty much just, me from the design cohort. A few people from business, engineering and science. In total, I think there were... 11 of us? And the teaching staff was about 6, even double or triple considering there were people presenting who were not part of this teaching cohort originally. There were three topics in place: STEAM, Assistive Technologies and Climate Change. I diverted all my knowledge powerhouse towards STEAM, as I had experience and theoretical backing all the way from Parsons. But in the end the decision was to place me in the Assistive Technologies team. The start was a bit strange and the structure of the course throughout the process a bit confusing. On one hand, I suspected, we'd be doing work that adhered to methodologies and scrupulous workload but in the end I would discover it was nothing as such. This was actually one of the reasons behind me taking ITF as a co-curricular subject - I didn't want to deal with anymore of the lax treatment of guidelines at this university and doing some weird shit with marking. So on one hand we'd be minded of keeping track of the design methodologies and on the other, we'd be minded this was not the priority at all. Very confusing, considering being mindful of methodologies was the primary thing I'd learn in last couple of years.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll skip to the stuff that I got shed light on quite soon, that made me realise perhaps that my actions to not treat the course at utmost seriousness considering the UoS guidelines. First assignment had about 4-5 paragraphs of what was expected, which I very much delivered. The word limit was not enforced so I focused on writing about my specialisation in-context of the topic. I felt it was a good paper. But what I'd receive, was, not too bad of a mark, 72 but it was the comments that concerned me the most, made out of 4-5 paragraphs again and that didn't suggest much in case of how it could've been improved, other than the structure could've been improved. Even despite no structure was imposed, essay or any other form. There were also comments that were already answered within the paper itself. This mirrored much of what I experienced at USYD in terms of the quality of teaching, one thing is to evaluate students but the other is to also provide actively feedback in terms of what needs improvement and I would not get this. So the lamps I'd get rumbling in my head. They rumbled with no error in place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The teaching part and the components of the course were very good, though. We were provided with a budget to spend on, whatever we needed or the project to come alive. Despite that the prototyping part was not favored, as in we'd get pretty much just a week or two in theory to make it happen, with the most time in theory being placed on research, ideation and business planning, this was still probably the first class I was taking in my last five years, that had a serious budget. We got about 1000$ of expenses approved. On top of which, we received tickets for Tech23 (valued at 99$) and we'd also get some pretty solid lectures concerning all spectra: business, theatrics, design, fabrications etc. So there was a lot of good in place. That goes without saying. Although, we would not learn of some events happening that were part of Spark Festival and the Innovation Festival happening at my faculty.

  The turning point came eventually. The first problem was, that the work was going slow. We'd be in relatively constant touch but that didn't mean that the work we'd be doing would be going ahead efficiently or effectively. We'd come together and think about certain aspects but it would never go ahead as fast unless we did parts of the work individually. This started to shift later, as the idea of the topic of our project was arbitrarily chosen by one of my team members, to which all of us agreed, me, for once, cause I didn't really care about the theme as long as we were going somewhere, which I feel was most of what all of us felt was the direction to go towards. But then, it felt as if I was doing most of the work by keeping mind of all the research methodologies that I have learned in last years. On one hand, drafting the interview scripts that once the interviews were on, my team members would not necessarily stick to and end up asking leading questions. They would also ask questions in a very informal manner that had emotional subtext, which I felt was quite very unprofessional but I could not intervene in the middle of it. The primary problem was and it always was, that in the end I would have to perform an entire transcription and thematic analysis of the thing. Doing this out of a 1.5h interview is not an easy thing to do. And then the analysis itself is also a feat of its own. My team members were not aware of how much time it takes. And in the end when we were doing the affinity diagram, they would source quotes from the work that I have done, which kind of made the entire idea of an affinity diagram void. It became even more concerning from my point of view, as for one of the next interviews, which took an hour, another team member was supposed to be transcibing the interview and thematically analysing it, especially that he didn't attend the interview (because train were running slow, very often he'd say that) but he didn't end up doing it at all. He would also come late to meeting, at times by 40 minutes. So, it did feel as if I was doing much of the work in the end.
</p>

<p>
  Then there was the other team member who was supposed to be doing research. And I'd get spammed with links, some of the links actual papers, publications, journal proceedings etc. Many of which informal links, though. Which was not a problem, as long as I believed the research was performed but whenever we'd end up meeting to discuss the presentation, the stuff on the slides would be extremely vague. To the point, the charts would not mean anything, for instance, the percentage of doctors at specific age believing assistive technologies could use innovation. At this point, I was sure, that the research was not done, just vaguely read. And later on, which felt more like a stab, was that most of the work I ended up doing, would not end up in the presentation, at all. And whenever I had concerns about the other parts, especially in terms of the looks of the presentation, which was my responsibility, the other team members would not budge at all. They'd be defensive as hell and I could not really bother with all this, especially they were doing the course for credit and I was not. In the end, I would start detaching and focusing on the execution of the prototype and related objects. This became a nightmare in the end, as, especially one team member would deem the prototype we have as very mediocre. Now that hurt, especially, considering I knew this was based on a project I did a semester ago and they're still showing it as example of a project well done. Once I had the prototype finished to the primary, first and raw version, the results were very mixed, due to a faulty projector and a faculty wireless tranmission dongle. In the end, the other team members didn't want to go ahead. And I didn't really want to have my name under the presentations that were being brewed as I felt they looked generic and where not as powerful start-up wise, due to what I learned in previous years, at all.
</p>

<p>
  In the end, I also fell sick. In a twisted turn of events, I could not perform work on a fever and with migranes so I ended up not being able to pull the remainder of work, so polishing up the prototype setup and my presentation slides. In the end, they presented and the presentation went quite well. Overtime. It had probably what it all needed. In the end, we all received actually really good marks. But, honestly, I don't believe they were all deserved as the work went all over and, I kind of felt used in the end. Just the fact I spent so much time working, most of the work did not end up on this project felt wrong. As well that my skills were not being really taken that much under consideration. That I've been the only one going to most of the events and gatherings related to our project. That I was CCing everyone in regards to our team's project and they were not. That my team members said they'd be doing something and they would not end up doing this. My team member being constantly late and taking breaks all the time and not doing the work really. My team members not being on the same page in terms of what we were doing and the constraints of the project. All of us having varying visions and one team member trying to change the nature of our project later on, cherry picking comments made during the feedback sessions from the earlier presentations and applying them to elements that were not even being given feedback to. And in the end, when I fell sick and I elicited the will to present the prototype, the other team members would pressure me to do more work, despite that I would be left in the dark in terms of whether I'd be presenting it or not, leading to big confusion and anxiety on my end, as I knew I'd be doing all the work and my team members wanted to be there when I presented the work. All this lead to a horrible experience in the end.

      Seeing how it all panned out, I guess I should be happy we received good marks but, I know the project was far from ideal so seeing how all this was being sanctioned in the way it was, I feel just drained, used and again having a bit of my usual PTSD stemming out of this institution. It's as if hard work and recognition of skills are not being valued at all. It's as if giving green light to people not doing work and them receiving great marks for this. It's as if doing at times a shoddy and shit job and really getting all the cake for yourself. I felt that perhaps such cases are one-off things but a few times throughout this semester I learned that the teaching staff is perfectly aware of all this and that students carry on in such manner and the teaching staff evaluates them as they evaluate. And it's as if there is nothing wrong with this. That's just not okay and I'm actually feeling happy that I'm about to finish my journey here. Although, perhaps having this mark of 83 on my transcript would've been actually beneficial in the end.
