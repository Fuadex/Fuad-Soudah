<p>
  So.
</p>

<p>
  It's been over a week. Or a fortnight? a month? a year? a decade or a fraction? I think by this stage it'd be almost 6 years since the start of my journey. Time flies and so does one's journey. The problem arises when I actually have to start really speaking about when it all started. As the norm would suggest to go chronologically but then think back 6 years and think if you remember all the details scattered across this time.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps the details won't matter as much as you can sort of recall many but what about the feelings you harboured and what they linked to? How they related from one point to a cluster of another and moving on? In such case, it would sort of makes sense to reverse the chronology and go from the point I am writing. But hey, should I type backwards all of a sudden?
</p>

<p>
  There must be an exit somewhere and a solution to how I'd like to build this structure as, I think, it may be of interest, if not necessarily for everyone outside of the circle, then at least for myself, as so often I can lose touch with all the accomplishments and loses I've succumbed to.

  <center><h4>19th of July</h4></center>
<p>
  As I'm writing these words it's currently the 19th of July. I'd like to think of a reason why I decided to start my first actual paragraph by writing a date, or should it be, a title of the first actual, or wait, perhaps second paragraph. See, let's scan through the last week or two and what I've actually been doing, from this date. I decided to suspend.. take a leave of absence from my latest studies. If you've known me for a while, you by now already know that I have been at studies for a long period of time. Now, that may be a pleonasm, cause a time is a period but if you think of it as part of the time, that goes on recurrently... it may still remain an error. But at this stage, I guess it was really sort of the second time I took a leave, from Animal Logic Academy at UTS. If you look back a year, at this time I was... yeah, where was I... I think at Warsaw, just between my studies, transitioning and thinking about my future in between having completed my exchange at Parsons School of Design and coming back to University of Sydney, where I still had my 6 Credit Points left to finish but as I reserved its completion on completing my last short-term exchange, to this today date I still haven't completed my Master's from this university. It doesn't make sense? Well, there is lots that doesn't in this story. But moving on and or back by 2 years from today, I have been completing my short-term exchange at KAIST in South Korea. I think pretty much exactly at this time. 3 years back? I was preparing to GTFO from University of Munich. 4 years? Well, I've been in Sydney, prepar.. hmm.. or was I? Let me check.
</p>

<p>
  See with memories becoming an issue at that stage, it is important to relay to references. Any good artist will tell you, that references are necessary. And so as my biological form of a Fuad cannot really hold the entire history of oneself, I have been hard at work keeping track of everything that has happened. Well, most of the interesting things that happened, at least I'd like to think this way. But as I'm looking these 4 years back, I just noticed some impossible things happening. On one hand it says that I've been on a eurotrip with my friends, which I have actually done shortly before going to Munich. But some photos suggest that I have been already there and on a trip somewhere. That doesn't make any sense now, does it? Is it me who's mistaking? Or EXIF information going berserk after having retrieved much of it from my cloud? It's hard to say, the key to this question may lay in the fact that... my eurotrip was in fact short, my comeback to Poland as well, to Australia even shorter and then all of a sudden I've been in Munich... ehh... I'll have to take a closer look at that. Fun fact, I had quite a bit of writing done at this period of time! (except for BENELUX without LUX trip). Well then, what did I do 5 years back? It looks like I've been flying back to Australia from Milan and completed some graphic design work for a friend of mine. And I might have been ferrying to a birthday party. 6 years back? .. I think it was getting ready to depart, very slowly, but getting ready to depart to Australia.
</p>

<p>
  And at this stage, I think I found the problem with what's happening with the photos. As date taken does not correspond with the file created time. I have no idea how that happened but see, what I have to deal with here, all my memories going up in a whirlwind of chaos!
</p>

<p>
  So to start fixing this, I think I will have to move back (on?) to present day. Cause as it seems, technology can also fail, even if it all seemed to have saved painlessly on digital drives. That having said, smartphone photo backup might just be more reliable so - there all the sorted pictures go, puff from my Microsoft Photos. Don't worry, they'll remain. I've done lots of work to get them to a workable state. And now it's becoming quite clear what I've been doing on these days and you know, I haven't been far off with most.

<p>
  Fast forward to this day, I'm looking at my past fortnight. And, you know, there were a couple elemenets. On one hand, kind of the nothingness that touches you when suddenly you're freed off from a major focus. That focus were my studies which I have enjoyed thoroughly, in fact, I think this was the studies that I have enjoyed the most of all the times I've studied. So why have I decided to take a leave of absence? Not just that but in fact planning to cut it short to a graduate certificate? Well, on one hand there's the money. But on the other, once covid happened, it all started feeling much less... but financial situation took the lead. Then there was the case of, well, if I'm not going to need to save up that much anymore, what could I do with the money I saved up till now? After receiving a boost and knowing that my old, 5 year old PC is dead (CPU or Motherboard issue), I decided to build a new one so I could continue with all the student software I have (that normally costs lots!) and continue educating myself within my own time and pace.
</p>

<p>
  But at that stage, you're kind of presented with the opportunity to do everything at once, at least that's how I saw it and quite really wanted to do everything. Having crossed paths with people who can speak +5 languages fluently, since these days I wanted to learn more languages. Since I've really enjoyed working with visual effects, now I want to specialise in visual effects and compositing, lighting, 3D modelling, everything. I want to know how to draw, paint, sculpt, cook, play instruments and mix music. And the truth is, that with enough dedication, all this is within my reach actually. At least I perceive it to be but nonetheless being so distant and with the cross of lacking and having motivation, withdrawal usually is the action that I'd tend to take. At this stage of the year I'd be probably travelling somewhere like I used to but since covid hit, that's no longer an option for now. I also wanted to lose weight. I managed to lose lots actually since 6 years ago and this year, I went on a 7-week long spree, going down to 73,9, moving back up to 82 and now since I'm on keto again, it's close to 75.9 with 2+ more weeks I plan to do this, planning go drill down to 72. Because I feel that now, that I have more time at hand, some goals are a bit clearer to be achieved actually. But I'm not entirely sure how clear it will be, the ability to achieve so much in the foreseeable future. To learn Japanese. To hear more books, which I've started listening to this year heaps actually. Imposing a new routine that could get me back up to speed with many things. Kind of feeling lucky and unlucky at the same time.
</p>

<p>
  I've already dedicated myself to taking specific actions. Taking the break. Assembling new PC parts. Much of this very carefully considered and executed fairly seamlessly. I have backed up a massive amount of knowledge and stuff I've harboured across the years. If put together properly, it could fruit off with some really decent stuff. Perhaps amazing stuff. One of the things that happens across years is that you forget stuff. And I feel writing up on stuff moving backwards across the years filled with, everything, could help me build something new and worthwhile moving forward.

	<p>
    It's one thing to prep up the plan in your head and another to actually execute it, or, at better least, assemble something that I would categorically adhere to fulfilling. I usually had problems all across the spectrum and required some serious scaffolding to construct to get things going. It was mostly psychological disposition that counted, sometimes it would require more effort and at times, things would not turn out in any way I've meant for it to. But whether it'd be performing extensive travel itenaries or thinking about watching a movie or two, in the end those things had a somewhat less noticeable link that was always there - there is lots of things that I'd like to do but it's not necessarily usually the case that I end up doing them - I'd like to say that'd be due to laziness but it was more due to some form of an internal inertia, as at times what I'd rather do is keep doing nothing for longer instead of actually doing something. Not doing anything however would fundamentally eat at me, as I'd increasingly become more and more aware of my wasteful actions in remaining at inaction. Usually the only way to break out of this would've been to make attempts at breaking the circle, just trying to go somewhere, do something and in the end that's how a lot of things would end up turning out - I'd eventually be doing something and then keep going at it, until I reached a void and succumbed back to the circle.
  </p>

  <p>
    This doesn't necessary remain for most of the time. Fast-forward today, 23rd of July. Memories flying and fading through. Last few days I've spent doing not many things. I dialed down on audiobooks and spent my focus on watching movies, although even the ever-growing list does not necessarily persuade me to keep binging. In the end, I believe there is a limit to how much culture I can dissolve in my head and the reflection part is also important. The two things about this, though, is that on one hand, often when I watch movies, I have these sudden flashes from my past, very specific moments from my life. And the other, is that I sort of sway towards watching the movies on my PC, rather than laptop.
  </p>

  <p>
    I at times wonder what's this about me prefering a much less mobile device, ever since I specifically bought a laptop so that I could work wherever and whenever I'd like to - completely free from any obtrusiveness. Once my PC decided to ultimately fall into the abyss of heavenly electronic circuitry and after deducting which parts were actually not really working well anymore, likely either CPU or Motherboard ever since the damn thing just shuts off after half a second, I decided boldly that it could be a good idea to invest in a new rig. The old computer was assembled cheaply, very even. At the time, I barely scrambled in fact, I believe I was living in student accommodation at University of Sydney and even in order to complete putting it together, I had to borrow a screwdriver from my faculty which I was happily given and I returned shortly after about 2 hours of getting stuff in. I bought a GPU and a power supply from a friend, a GTX970 and a Corsair 650W for about, I believe, 600$. Bit of a bargain, normally it'd be almost twice as much and the GPU was slightly overclocked compared to regular blocks. The rest were fairly cheap parts mostly bought from MSY: one of the cheaper cases, 16 GB of RAM, 250 GB SSD, an some 8-threaded intel i5 CPU. I think I closed the entire setup in about 1000-1500$ with the addition of a VN BENQ monitor (EW2440). It was quite an expense at the time but I used it quite often, played many games, enjoyed the extra power that I would not receive from my Surface Pro 3, so I used it as an additional power house. After 5 years, this all went out and as I was leaving ALA, I figured, high time to put money into something new that I can make use of the new toys I have (Houdini, Foundry software etc.).
  </p>

  <p>
    I must say, I am in a frankly very different situation today, as I have Surface Book 2 at my disposal, which in fact was faster in many cases then my old PC. That's the convenience I was looking forward to having ever since I was preparing to buy Surface Pro 3. So why even take interest in a new PC if the laptop cuts the cake already? Well, I got to work at ALA on some really sweet rigs: 2x Xeon boxes with 56 threads, 128 GB RAM, a renderfarm that had over 500 TB free space and Quadro M4000 cards. These were really, really fast and really comfortable to work with. Unfortunately, for CG my laptop is not exactly there and the thermal and power throttling was totally an issue, usually not with games but try rendering anything when you require the CPU to keep going at 100%. So I started researching, day after day, for quite a bit of time, weighing my options and leaning towards one combination or the other. It's a very bad time to be buying computer parts, this should be noted, a new generation of graphic cards are fast-approaching towards the end of the year along with a new generation of CPUs. The pandemic took a swing at the availability and the prices of computer parts, lifting many of them by 10%, 100$ etc. And while I was carefully awaiting shifts on pcpartpicker, I'd notice that some damn things would instantly hit new highs. In the end, I settled on a few things: an AMD Ryzen 3900X, 128 GBs of RAM, 2 TB SSD as key components and to have 2 ethernet slots and to keep my old GPU if still working. I just wanted to replicate as much of the studio setup as possible, potentially even surpassing its computational power as I heard from friends that their rigs were just faster than the studio ones. But then I began to find some very interesting things.

	<p>
    First of all, times have changed and lots of the technical stuff I've known years prior, now are just different. Perhaps I should consider Intel? Their CPUs seem stronger in games and in many other applications while being competitive with top AMD ones. This triggered alarms in my head but then I also considered this: intel seemed to have lots of issues lately, safety-wise having holes like crazy, not applying enough thermal paste on their CPU<->Cooler, being too power-hungry, changing motherboard chipsets too often. And from my personal experience, the damn throttling was an issue even in my old computer. I would have to invest in some of the top dogs on the market, as the 3900x is a 12-core monster, 24 threads. Intel has something similar but with 10 cores (then I found something else but it didn't change much). Eventually, I heard of a refreshed series of 3900XT coming out, a definitely money-grab from AMD, as apparently they'd ask for much more, sell without a cooler and... well just for an extra 100 MHz... I settled to wait, as there were many rumours and the tests didn't confirm it'd be a good decision to go with this but it seemed handy at medium-thermal applications like Adobe Creative Suite. I decided to dial down on the RAM to 64 GB, yet faster ones - 3600 MHz. It was a pain to find a good vendor, most things seemed to be coming from Newegg and I read it could take weeks before I receive the package. Apparently, in any case, AMD works well with larger sticks and higher MHz. I found almost at the last very last day steel Patriots on Amazon, that'd be delivered the next day. Other parts were the Motherboard - on one hand, I was driven away from MSI as apparently they had werid software issues with voltages. Then I hovered around more expensive options with 2 ethernets as I intended to plug in WD MyCloud external drive... that started having issues lately. Buggr'all. In parallel I went out looking for cases. The problem with all this is, that there is a crazy amount of those out there. Try finding what ya'd like. But I found a fairly new company and stuff I'd like and what I was looking for was clear - simple design, as quiet and cold as possible considering what it'd be packing. And it became clear, going for Fractal Design would be the choice, as it packed additional USBs in the front, with USB-C and... now which motherboard could handle this? As not all have enough connectors. The 2x ethernet didn't. But in the end, there weren't many motherboard choices to be sorted from back in Australia anyway. But there was something just coming in, MSI X570 Tomahawk. Going with X570 was supposed to be future-proof, it had everything I needed and apparently its electrical parts were robust. I also liked it didn't have tons of LEDs, apparently these days kids buy everything with LEDs, cause 'it makes their PC look faster' or something, the damn mobos even have pins for additional LEDs. But anyway, this one seemed optimal. The other two parts were: power supply, which I just knew I wanted a larger yet from a reliable company. At first, I was like - Corsair 850W! But then I found a better, slightly more expensive option from Fractal Design 860W, with 80+ Platinum badge (which I'm almost sure doesn't matter as much), fully modular and an option for fanless work (which works apparently only until it requires more than 300-sth W). The remaining component was the SSD. And I discovered a few things: new standards, NVM, QLC, different M2 standards - wtf, also the prices about which I'll soon say more. I opted for the 2 TB as I needed lots of space (512 GB is nowhere near I need, 1 TB will go out in a year I think). I went with Samsung EVO PLUS 970 as it seemed the fastest and I had good experience with samsungs which reviews seemed to backup + it had a cashback offer of 79$. Well, one more thing, since the CPU doesn't come with a fan - Be Quiet, Pure Rock 2 was the choice I made, juggling from a few ones and even opting for a larger one considering it had a screwdriver but opted out since it had issues with RAM and I wanted something that already had thermal paste on it.

    The primary reason for building a new computer was to have a setup on which I could do CG-work at my own pace. The choice of components primarily has driven it and despite I opted for a bottle-neck in form of an old GPU, I planned to add more RAM, a new GPU from the Ampere GTX3xxx and a new monitor for colourists, to have 2 to work on anyway. The choice of components was... heavy financially but I had a budget set aside since I considered continuing ALA, although, I knew it wouldn't be really possible to keep going with it financially at full-spectrum. As Australia is not a larger market and I kind of wanted to have the components as fast as possible, I decided to opt for ordering at domestic companies, so I eluded newegg and international shipping on amazon. Pcpartpicker would still not list everything unfortunately so I had to make an initiative to google alternatives at my own discretion on google. It was a very time-consuming effort and in the end I had doubts I could do all this. Sort of this feeling at the back of my head, that, all this is a massive undertaking, many components cost a fuckton, 200$, 400$, 600$ per component - that's crazy. I progressively considered the fact that most people place most of their money into other components and perhaps I should to, as their PCs would be sort of faster than mine. I could've gone with 3900x which in theory could shave off over 200$ with the fan but the differences on the domestic market more reflected a 50$ difference. So I got the components from about 4-5 different shops: RAM from amazon (came first), case from umart (that came last from Brisbane and I had to chase them up as their dispatch took over 3 days!), ssd from Centrecom (Melbourne), CPU from CCPU (Calingford Sydney), Fan, Motherboard and power supply from Mwave (Lidcombe Sydney) and... The sydney stuff I decided to pickup in person to dodge delivery fees. Also I had to do bank transfers as apparently cards get surcharged 1-2% which can be quite substantial when you're spending 2750$ on parts. The weak aussie dollar definitely did not help either (1 U$D ~ 1.45 AU$). But after being worried like hell with the PC case not coming and me picking up my parts on a diet, receiving calls that they still did receive the cpu delivery and that it will definitely rain and the Mwave pickup was too large for my backpack, carrying heavy and expensive components half across Sydney, eventually by Thursday, the process of ordering and receiving parts were completed within 8 days. Crazy how much stretching I had to do, also financial-wise, in certain cases the delivery fees could've topped even 80$ and the transation fees damn it. But hey I got everything and had to start assembling. Oh, I also picked up a screwdriver on the day I was picking up my pc parts and I was so surprised how cheap just stuff for building is... comapred to my PC parts? Ha!
  </p>

  <p>
    Assembly was a bit weird. At first I had to definitely check out what was the issue with the old PC, so I tested the power supply, which I also thought might be the thing. But it wasn't. It was the CPU or motherboard. First impression of the stuff I had, it's all nice and black, no LEDs so great! Except a small part on the motherboard that doesn't make a difference. Second, the case is excelent. Extremely modular and soundproofed from like everywhere. It had everything I need, it will be easy to clean as I can pull stuff from different ways. After assembly I also noticed the air flow is excellent. In these terms I have to say PC manufacturers have improved in every single way. Instructions were attached with each box actually. A friend suggested I start from Motherboard which I did, after mounting the power supply which was a bit of a pain. What interested me, was that the fan was heading downwards in the manual, as the power supply would be mounted at the bottom. The power cables would also go behind the back of the PC, to make space and keep the airflow proper in the case. This made some issues to assemble the side of the PC, though as the cables would keep plopping it out. It's fine now, though. As always, I'd be very careful, even extremely with assembling the parts. In fact, I was scared that either some components would malfunction or I'd screw something up. First, the CPU. The socket was slightly different to Intel but the installation seemed very simple. The CPU box was large but the CPU itself small and fairly heavy actually. It didn't look any really different from its intel competition yet it seemed to pack much, much more in on it. I carefully place it exactly as I should and closed it. Then I got the RAMs in. The packaging is bit weird with all these components I should also mention. Not that many extras came with the motherboard but quite a lot with the powersupply and the case, Fractal is great with these. The RAMs came in just as they should like with the old ones, I put them in channels 1 and 3. And then the fan, which is a bit of a hassle to mount. At first I had to be careful with the thermalpaste. Also figuring out the screwhandles on the CPU were a bit unclear so I clarified those with an online video. In the end while I assembled the cooler, I think I got the cooler a bit sliding but it's hard not to, as I was mounting the motherboard... on my bed (you shouldn't do this but I figured it wouldn't matter as much, just a bit uncomfortable stability-wise). I noticed the paste got almost a bit off the cpu but there was enough that I was confident I wouldn't have issues with the paste itself. Mounting the fan was weird, though, as I didn't know which position to put it on, the height seemed arbitrary and I just had to guess what would be best for the airflow (probably higher due to RAM sticks). Also the fan itself also was a bit quirky as it is slightly larger one way. The instruction didn't quite tell how it should be assembled, the way it should at least so I got the larger part towards the out of the case. The fan would also have to be kind of primitively attached at force to the cooler, which seemed weird as the fan is plastic and the temperatures could get quite big on the cooler. But anyway, I got it all up, just had to reattach the fan so that the cable would fit comfortably on the socket. At this point, I had to attach the motherboard to the PC case and to do it comfortably I had to remove the uppert part of the case (super modular, again). Then it was the turn for getting the SSD attached. And how fucking surprised I was to see how freaking tiny this M2 is. Compared to my hard drives and even a regular external or internal SSD and I have a small microSD 512 GB in my laptop installed, seeing these 2 TB packed into literally a size of 2/3 of my hand's small finger opened my eyes, very, wide, open. As this is one of the fastest standards, the bloody thing can get things read off at 3.5 TB/s and written at 2 TB/s, in theory. This was my first encounter with these, so I didn't quite mount it after getting the heatsink off (and I had to pull the paper off it too at the end that I almost forgot about). At first I thought it'd go horizontally in but something didn't seem right. Then I read and looked up on the internet that it gets mounted at 30 degrees to its holding block, crazy, why would anyone come up with such mechanism instead of a simple pull in. But after I got that in, carefully and screwing in what needed to be screwed (with super-tiny screws), all was set. Not the GPU mount was straightforward and then sorting out the cables, which was a bit of a hassle as I had to reposition HDD cage in the case as I could no get the power cables in (hehe, modular, hehe, convenience). Once that was settled I had to bind the cables properly, which was a bit of a hassle as well, as I mentioned the side of the case coming off repeatedly due to cables being too large. These are freakin' fractal components, these should be meant to work together. Modularity can be an issue, as at that stage I was afraid that lifting the case it would all fall apart hah. Also, connecting the front I/O was a bit weird as I had to read-in closely, the motherboard didn't clearly indicate what goes where. But in the end I got it all, took a few hours I think, about 3 I think, after rechecking and making sure that everything got set. It's very easy to fuck up actually in the past now that I thought about it, because now, with the cable management, which made sense considering the systems are more powerful nowadays and everything should sort of make more sense these days anyway,
  </p>

  <p>
    I moved on to the last step - put the PC on. I connected the power supply cable. Flicked the on switch. And pushed the front button. All the fans momentarily went full-on. Very swiftly and remarkably quietely regardless actually... And after about 10 seconds I saw things on the motherboard. First, that I didn't connect my RAM optimally. I reset it and took a picture and could not believe that the 'optimised' setup is to get the RAM into channels 2 and 4, not clearly indicated in the manual. So adjusted that little thing and then had to go into BIOS and setup XMP profiles, so that the RAM ran at 3600 MHz. Not BIOS, UEFI, sorry. Still, there wasn't too much stuff to do there. There was a Game boost option, which clearly was OC (350 MHz to basic setup). Now it was just a different test, see if RAM speeds are okay and they were, DDR4 n' all. And now I just put my USB I had to order (32 GB, waterproof and everything from samsung at 15$ on a student discount) in the front USB 3.0 panel. Reset the computer and... it all went like a piece of cake. Went forward, forward, put in the Windows Education serial number and the windows wanted me to provide a work email (in the edn it didn't seem I needed to do this anyway). And there were a couple of things that I didn't quite actually know or like while installing Windows 10 Education. But damn it installed so... so... fast. It took maybe a minute which got me. I also screwed in the wifi antennas and it all worked out of the box, again, surprise - how bloody seamless all this was. I was setting up the name and all and had windows installed in no-time and updated it in no-time.

   At this stage I still was a little worried whether my choices were fine and whether everything will be going fine. I installed as much key software as possible. And I kept on being in awe of how much I liked the setup. It was extremely quiet. Unbelieveable actually. The way it works is that the power supply's fan doesn't even spin normally and even if it spins, you barely hear it. Maybe 20 dB? GPU's fans also don't really spin normally, only when it needs. The other fans, I can't say I hear them, the sound dampending is too damn good. So... so... quiet. You just don't hear this. It's quieter than my laptop in fact and the only thing you may hear is the external HDD, which is absolutely crazy. So I had to put it up for a test - rendering in Houdini! And playing Witcher 3 to see how the components work at 100% stress. The CPU fan starts spinning faster but I don't think it surpasses 30 dB, which is still sound dampened so it's not really noticeable actually. Same goes for the GPU. What got me staggered, though, is just how bloody fast the CPU is, though. The 64 KB cache. The in theory just 3.8 GHz for all-cores at stress and 4.7 GHz at turbo. In the end, it is 4.77 GHz at turbo and figures closer to 4 GHz all-across-cores were being noted at the expense of max 81 Degrees. If there is need for less cores, the CPU very quickly adjusts the turbo values as well, so swiftly that the max turbo core quickly is being recorded all across the cores, depending on the need. I'm not entirely sure how to put it into words but basically in short, I have never seen such power in just a simple computer - it's just so fast, even faster than the ALA computers I believe and even at top loads I was still able to use other applications comfortable without much even at all noticeable issues or throttling of any sorts. It's just pure power. Unbelieavable. And the rendering, crazy fast. It was at this point that I realised that my choices were actually right and that I got everything I researched, thought of and was working towards - a thing that very often would make me satisfied, of a job well done. Because now I have the power to do everything I've wanted, at the convenience of my own home. And even the GPU isn't much of a throttle at this stage. Crazy, crazy, crazy and me being extremely satisfied. Even despite the costs that were in fact really crazy. Can you believe the SSD was one of the most expensive things in my PC? After getting all the software in, I still have a huge margin of stuff I can put on it. Much of it was an expense, an investment that I can sort of make use of anywhere as I have high-speed internet to work with too, 100/40 with an option to go faster if needed. Having options on the table, beautiful. And hey, the SSD will turn out cheaper due to Samsung's 79$ cashback.

    So which direction should I take this forward afterwards? A wireless keyboard could be of use. A second screen that will be hardware-calibrated for sRGB, Adobe RGB and that sorts. Interestingly, the old 22" monitor I have is still pretty good, although a notch dark, the colour rendition is fairly excellent. It did come with a hot pixel, though. And a higher resolution and space to look at could be of use. Sometime in the future an extra 64 GB of RAM for more intensive work. I'm not sure switching the CPU is going to be a good idea, even if I hear good things about the upcoming Ryzen lineup, I'm frankly quite suspicious of any CPU that comes with na iGPU, just due to the potential throttling issues. I might be mistaken or misguided by my experience with what was going on with my laptops and even PC but I still believe dedicated GPUs are a better choice in tandem with CPU and the new lineup doesn't look like to feature anything as powerful as 3900XT in fact, turbospeed-wise, number of core-wise etc. Someday I may go with an extra M2, if prices go really down and I'm in need of extra very fast speeds. I might put the old 250 GB SSD just for the sake of having a Windows 7 backup. DVD/Blue-rays don't make sense anymore these days and my PC case... well, does not foresee the need of one anyway. Obviously, a new GPU could come in handy but that's still a song of the future. For now I'm just enjoying the quite heavy expenditure of 2750$ on the parts but I'm already putting them to a good use.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may be wondering what's it got to do with all the bit more retrospective outlook that I was supposed to feature. Well, in order, also for me, to understand myself it is necessary to go deep in-detail of my decision-making and such. In this case, the idea was to self-educate myself at home, continue at my own pace and have the capacity to do so. But did this actually do what I intended for it to do?
