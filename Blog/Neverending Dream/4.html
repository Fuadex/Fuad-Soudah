    <center><h4>Re-stiching</h4></center>
<p>
 After having completed my Photos backup I moved onto another format. As I've been continuously getting my files across onto my phone from Gear 360, I realised a few things. Well, at first, that I've got the huge over 600 GB repository of files. And I found that there are ways to get them stabilised. And that the stabilisation keeps failing in After Effects. But there are other ways to treat these materials. Because it's all about perspective. And perspective can be anything.
</p>

<p>
  But in order to get these files across, first I need to keep my phone alive, otherwise nothing will get across. So either I keep using it or just swiping across to keep it woke. Doing some duolingo, browsing through some news in the meantime. Oh, charging my gear 360 as it dies after an hour of transferring. And I do all these in batches. Oh, I have to transfer another batch from my phone over my laptop to the microsd, as gear 360 prevents from getting anything saved on it. Oh, I had some other weird errors, like one file weighed 10 GB. Ehhh... This will take a while but I got a niff of something cool that I could do.

  <center><h4>Even more words</h4></center>
<p>
 So as I am committing to getting all my precious data to life, I have to have some other things to keep an eye on in the meantime. So as I'm writing these words now, I kind of don't really feel like writing. In recent days I've been doing a mix of things, transferring files across, doing some post-processing in Lightroom, reading up a bunch on the net, getting a couple of promising tools running in Houdini, crossing a couple of ideas and bringing them to life. Found out that VLC handles processed photos and videos well but unprocessed not quite well. I was especially in awe of how 360 photos and videos can be seen from a different perspective. For once, on my Gear 360 app, with some extreme FOVs. Then I found out I can do the same on my VLC. Then I discovered that my 360 videos I put up on youtube do not stream in 4K anymore but just 1080p, WHAT THE FUCK YOUTUBE? Facebook seems to handle 360 videos better and provide better customisation options. But in the end, this is not the first time that I lose faith in youtube.
</p>

<p>
  Then there was the case of me being happy seeing that finally there is a tool for 360 video stabilisation. It's not like it wasn't really existing before but it was incredibly cumbersome to get up and running, in fact, it didn't really run and processing all my videos totally crazy, with each needing over an hour to process. With my new PC rig, it seems like something of the past, as the 12 cores should crunch through anything I throw at it. And in fact that was the case, until I found out that AE keeps throwing errors and stalling me. Which is a bit sad as if it didn't, I could do some cool compositing on top, with 3D letters and more. Stabilisation done within the gear 360 app unfortunately doesn't work well and I had issues with decreased quality of the output videos and the angles going totally nuts, which likely isn't due to the app itself (at least I don't think it is but could be) but just weird values read from the camera's gyroscope - at least that's what I tell myself that.
</p>

<p>
  So then I came up with an idea as I really enjoyed these warped perspective videos ALA Redline style, thinking, what if I set up some of them and recorded this way in VLC. But it seemed like some folks came up with this idea already, from GoPro, who created a plugin for Premiere and After Effects in which all perspectives can be managed and keyframed flawlessly. Suddenly, something veeeeeery promising fell in my hands. I'm just thinking how cool it's going to be, I've just been thinking yesterday how cool it could be if I just did 20-minute long episode edits compared to unedited hour-long sequences of me just going everywhere. Suddenly I can have incredible perspectives embedded, subtitles to translate my Polish sentences. Lots of creative freedom and extra post-processing and who knows, maybe I could do even some weird-ass tracking + compositing, although I'm afraid that the crazy FOVs and fisheye-freestyle may create more errors than I'd hope for. So in the meantime, I just need to process as much material as possible, hope that my phone won't run out of space, the battery won't die and after a couple of days, hoping my external drive won't run out of space either, I will be able to create something actually very worthwhile, not just for me but also for other people. Like my own shows, with episodes and seasons and all the stuff, that won't be just pure documentary but sort of a... biographical piece? Could be, could be.
</p>

<p>
  So in the meantime, I'll just let my phone process, for now material I've recorded in Japan and whatsoever came afterwards. And in the meantime? I'll continue translating my earlier blogs. For now Sehnsucht.

    <center><h4>Cleaning Up</h4></center>

<p>
  One of the things I've been doing in parallel to cleaning up and sorting out the stuff I have on my drives and integrated circuits is cleaning physically my room. Well, of course, cleaning your room and in fact the entire house is an important feature. Gotta keep things clean and tidy, for your health and wellbeing and peace of mind etc. etc. The fact is that I haven't been really prudent in terms of cleaning, so let's say: vacuuming about every +2 weeks, same with laundry, once I really have lots to get in, I prefer to do everything in larger batches when I really have to. But this does not necessarily walk in pair with stuff that I just chuck away. So for instance, I had a quite substantial amount of boxes stacked at the corner of my room and in my wardrobe. I'm not sure if it's a sentimental thing or... who knows. The case is, that all those cases I've kept stacking for probably around ever since I moved into the place I am in now, so that's about 5 years if I'm counting correctly. That means that lots weren't really touched ever since, which isn't a good thing. Then there are all these things that I threw into the drawers, like receipts, papers, important documents, computer parts, old smashed phones and whatever I deemed of a minimum slight importance that I do not necessarily want to chuck into the bin. I knew this would turn against me eventually but today with more free time at hand, I don't think I have leeway of being able to just simply rebuke with that I don't have time. I have all of it in the world. But it doesn't necessarily mean that I will do everything in one batch, as it's simply just not really possible - I'd need to spend an entire day probably and I'd only get through maybe a quarter. As I need to single-handedly review every single and each item, which in turn usually flick a memory switch - most of them I look back fondly on.
</p>

<p>
  The entire process I've started about two weeks ago, as I concentrated on going through the packages and inspecting whether I haven't left any documents or accessories in them. Usually that's not the case but there were usually stragglers. Of course, upon getting all the old boxes sorted I started to comprehend again, just how many things came through my hands in the last few years. I have mentioned that I do not tend to hoard stuff and buy lots of things, as I just simply put think that I do not need lots of things to be happy. But over the course of a few years there can be really a lot of things that do in fact come through your hands. And in my case, it was quite a bit, not sure if I should even mention all, from computer parts to drives and accessories, mostly electronics - but what's more important, it's fairly expensive electronics, unless I've completed all the stuff by this day, I'm not really convinced I would have had the opportunity to lay my hands on even the vast majority of it. Of course, people are in charge of their own life and they craft their way towards success, at least that's an, I guess, I hate saying this word as it doesn't make in a way sense, romantic way of comprehending life, which sort of distorted greatly on my end, as if I didn't really have that overwhelming final say influence, yet still ended up to this day well and always thinking that this is the end of the line and there won't be anymore, let's say, pleasant surprises of fate forming a wider smile. 
</p>

<p>
  In the end, I got lots of the standalone stuff out. There were some old projects, like a dismantled wooden smartweight, broken into pieces Hologram-like device. Some of this stuff I received funds (in a way, as part of a team) from the university as an example. Lots of ad-like stuff and freebies I received landed in the bin. But lots of the boxes did end up stacked, just in the garage instead of my room. I guess I'm not big on having my room as a garage, although I know some folks who not only keep a garage without a driveway, where they socialise aussie style but even folks who live in a garage. I'm not sure if I should be one of them, though. Afterwards, or somewhat in parallel, I started cleaning my desk and I assembled the remaining piece as I felt it could be fine to have more easily accessible stuff on top, like an extra drawer, that I had perpendicularly stacked in the corner, it got quite dirty after these years. I took out a couple of things that were left by my father in my room like some sort of vases and alike and then I started vacuumin'. Over the course of these 2 weeks I'd spend an hour or a few going making a bit or a larger sweep as many items would end up moving between places. I discovered a massive amount of microUSB cables, which I thought interesting as I always was looking for more. Chargers even. IEM insertion rubber-thingies (like these modular thingos you attached on your IEMs). Some cleaning brushes I thought I had lost years prior. Pairs of IEMs but I think I mentioned that a while back. And there were some posters that I had at home. Some are quite badly damaged but a few I kept alive for less than a year, as these weren't printed by me - they were shown in galleries and returned to me after the exhibition was over. I thought it'd be nice to have them to be seen to remind me of some successes. Because there were many and as I rolled through the drawers I'd keep finding many. I at times wondered in my past why people have so many posters and pictures and photos scattered around their rooms, as I tend to keep walls clean. I'm still not sure if I totally understand this phenomenon but I got my head around to introducing some around me, a few years back and today but in a significantly reduced volumes. It's just nice to have them around to, I guess, keep your mind's integrity. Of course, reasons may vary.

    A few other things I've discovered was that I chucked away my graduation items into one of the drawers. There were the certificates and materials that I have used to attain those. Like my graduate degree. Like my KAIST short-term exchange completion. And my Parsons exchange. Even my graduation hat. As I went through all these, I noticed so many things and recalled as many. For instance, just how little I thought of my graduation day, as it correlated with just how my degree went. And it went fabulously but there were certain expectations that I had about and with it, that did not materialise just yet. Looking at these documents I kind of did understand, though, that I perhaps did not put enough value on just how much work went towards getting through all this and in fact how much I achieved. I just reminded myself, that I cannot find my LMU certificate, though. I sort of do not feel a large tragedy coming out of this but I'm confident that I'll find it after a while of digging through all my drawers. The Parsons certificate especially made me feeling very warm, as I just recalled how I threw literally everything at it and it was the largest surprise once I learned that I actually got in. There are no words to put how much it did not make sense that this could happen. But I guess, in case of schools like these, such success stories may just be paving way for people and the Americans are, from the outside very slightly understood but once you get to know it, New York, you sort of just really want to go back...
  </p>

  <p>
    There is still lots of stuff I have scattered around but I already completed cleaning a few drawers and items around. It's still not finished but intend on continuing to simplify all these. On the other hand, I began drilling a bit more into the files I have at hand. I continuously process the big gigabytes of 360 material and it's taking me days and I'm not even halfway through. But it's going. Charging my phone. Charging my 360. Stitching files. Transferring files. I have plans for all this. And I plan on getting some experimental stuff in. I'm not sure how well it will all turn out but in parallel I've been doing some houdini stuff and pushing my PC to rerender photos in a simulated way. I found a couple of really cool ideas and I plan to incorporate them in a couple of projects. Also these blogs as the aesthetics are quite something. Although, doing all the renders and testing takes a toll even on this PC and I have to really juggle between quality options and even renderers, as some files could render for months, yet in specific renderers, half a minute.... CG continues to amaze me. And what on top of it all I do? I watch TV Shows and anime. I think it's also a good way to kill time, as I broaden my knowledge of what is out there. As, despite I already know a bit and I kind of feel still left a bit behind and I guess in the end I've chosen the cultural way. From other news, my weightloss program is being stalled at the moment at 76. I was hoping to reach 72 already... well, can't argue with my body I guess.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had today the pleasure of continuing stitching my 360 material. Right, I said that earlier. Mmm... That I'm reviving some cool FX techniques and experimenting? Oh that too... well, I've been having lots of work with Adobe Premiere as it seems to be killing my GPU, freakin' Adobe. So instead I'm rendering on my CPU, hehs, which surprisingly takes less time than if I was to use the GPU. Life. I had the pleasure of being invited to the final presentation from the school I left, though. I felt a bit uneasy about appearing, as, basically, I feel if I'm absent then I should be absent, other students are paying fees and I am not and in addition, I feel most of the work was done by the rest of the group, as my Unity fibbles didn't go through due to the project being raised by an amazing friend of mine in Unreal and the rest did a fantastic job. I guess I could see still that there were elements of me in there, obviously the earlier discussions we'd had, steering the project towards what it eventually became, the aesthetics transferred in a relative formula and the feel definitely came through, over which developing I had some influence in the earlier stages of the project. But overall, the overall majority was all the titanic work performed by people who remained in team 7 and as part of the course, I was incredibly excited to see what has become of the project and how strong it has become. I feel a bit sad that I won't be really able to throw such a piece on my portfolio, as almost none of the work presented actually was derived from my direct doing but that doesn't keep me from being proud for my team members and how their potential got to shine with all their strengths unleashed on a level that I think all of us were looking forward to, working as part of a larger group. In this case, it was a small group but looking back on all the chilled conversations we'd had and how I enjoyed working, even though remotely, it's just pleasure knowing of how it all beautifully turned out. I wonder if they'll win? I'm counting on this, I felt the project was ultimately the strongest of all developed in studio 2.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes I wonder, whether if I actually stayed, whether the project would reach such quality. All in all, to be honest, I did feel pretty disconcerted but not with the team but with my own progress and where I'm actually going and whether I actually want to keep doing all this, working to the limit and seeing where I end up. Because whenever I did push beyond the 100%, I would never really reach exactly where I wanted to be. I'm not even sure if I actually know the place that I wanted to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh, what's that? My render rendered? Cool!

   Another day another dollar. Or perhaps another dollar spent? Not necessarily! One of the beautiful details of the ketogenic diet concept, is that, well, you kind of should impose a calorie deficit in order to battle your, um, weight I suppose. So that means, that, if you're cutting calories, then you are most likely also going to cut down on expenditures. Although I heard it's a bit of a flowed concept, as imposing a deficit does not always equal losing weight. That having said, the if the balance is skewed one way and by even larger amounts, such as 50% deficits, then you will most definitely going to lose weight, energy doesn't come from nowhere fool! Then again perhaps I might be one, as for about 2-3 weeks I've been stalling but also I was imposing lesser deficits and eating keto bars, in theory everything works still but the performance is slightly worse than I would have liked. As part of the keto journey it is sort of important for me to look out for different foods that I might incorporate into my diet. On one hand, it's a bit of a double-edged sword. It's sort of better to stick to the foods you already have faith in terms of how it tastes and how it reacts to your cravings after having devoured your meal. On the other hand, you can't expect yourself to just keep eating steaks with spinach for an entire month. Even though delicious, at some point you will start getting tired of the same meals you keep preparing yourself and in addition, eventually you will develop cravings for some sorts of sweats. This is sort of the part that gets tricky, as there are some sweeteners that you may use to substitute sugar that just work. But they may lead you towards actually veering off the diet. In my case, I usually keep a lid on this, in the end I'm a bit of a keto veteran and after doing a bit of searchy searchy, I found a really cool bakery that does everything keto/low-carb. They also do once a month on saturdays an open-kitchen, so I figured it's a great idea to check them out. I rolled out early in the morning, about 6.30 am woke up, prepared, took a train at freakin' 3 degrees in the morning apparently (yes, Sydney gets cold during winter). Reached fairly early at Central, even despite there were trackworks on the weekend, so I picked up a few things at officeworks, like bubblewrap as I intend on RMAing a pair of IEMs and some glue spots to stick a poster or two. And then I headed towards the open-kitchen, kinda got into a mistake of taking the wrong bus and taking off and on to the right one. And in the end I reached the destination, finding a queue already in which I spent about 20-30 minutes. I mean, go figure, the only keto bakery I think in NSW if not Australia as a whole, you're gonna get some movement here.

    They had some cool stuff. Imagine: vanilla slices, chocolate tarts, brownies, vegemite scrolls (they have cinnamon ones stored). They also have some other meals like even lasagna etc. All keto/low-carb. Quite amazing. For about 7 items I spent 55$ and I got a discount on the tart as it lost a raspberry. The lady who served me was super nice, explained how they work, what they serve, we had a bit of a conversation on the food and who cooks and decided to give me slightly larger slices since she thought I was skinny. Paid contactless, very nice people. I ate on my way two things and I was already full. Took a walk around the neighbourhood. Grabbed myself a cup of coffee from a very busily attended cafe, someone grabbed my small long black, damn. I got served a large instead. I walked a bit more around the quite wonderful neighbourhood. During my eating on the go of my tart, a person living in the neighbourhood noticed my act of devouring the tart by remarking 'yummy!'. I moved towards USYD as I wanted to get a few documents printed and found that my card doesn't work as I'm 'absent'. I moved towards Broadway and noticed The Toby's Estate coffee place, that was reorganised. I noticed two very promising packs of coffee, one especially that seems like a standard blend that apparnetly tastes like... molasses, berry, brown sugar. And I was thinking like, damn, I think I had that kind of coffee in Korea and I was in love with it. Have I found a similar blend? I got an extra single-origin Ethiopia, which promises floral, peach and apple juice - I like floral part and Ethiopian/Kenyan beans are freakin' great allround, should be perfect for my delter press. I also got a complimentary coffee to the beans, damn, another coffee? I got a small one which wasn't bad as usual from this estate, except, it clearly felt like espresso - quite heavily infused aromas but I could figure peaches/sour cherries from these - not bad but I prefer more nuanced and fairbodied cups. The one I had earlier, I don't remember how it tasted except it was good... I think a blend of dark chocolates and I think cherries, it was solid bolid, though. Afterwards I moved towards finding a place to print - one place closed even though says it's open, another one also closed wtf. And so I moved towards the city centre through Darling Harbour, oh oh, before before after the first coffee place I landed at USYD to eat another 3 items. Jesus now I was really full + I was at woolies before the second coffee place to grab myself some water, apparently spring carbonated australian - quite refreshing. Are you lost already? Fast-forward to city center, I moved towards another woolies through darling harbour to grab myself another ION sugerfree powerade, found that microsoft store is still damn closed despite I will need to get my book warrantied, moved towards COS where they have a sale but it's only on items on sale and I didn't really find anything I really wanted (except maybe some boxers?). And eventually I found my way to Circular Quay because I haven't been there in a while, found that MCA is reorganised, the trains do not work at Circular Quay, so I took a tram to Central Station to change to a train to Sydenham where I changed train to my Macarthur train and went all the way to Minto. Around this time I found out that I was walking for a lot of kilometers and I haven't been moving a lot so I fucked up one of my feet, so I was kind of having some trouble, as I limped home, stopping by woolies to get some water. The problem could be that my hiking shoes overheated, even despite it was cold outside or the airflow wasn't great due to my act of impregnating them with wax, as these shoes need waxing every couple of months or so, so they don't go bust. But instead I found my feet going bust and you know, not that I am surprised, in the end it was 16 km today. I do at times more, much much more when I travel but hey, I haven't been doing much travelling lately. It should do well for my weightloss program, though, I hope for another year... wait, what? a month I meant!

    Question is, why am I even mentioning all this? Well, for once, it kind of shows how I just do things. Sometimes, I like to tick off everything on my headlist within one day + do a little more if feasible. That's what I got but sometimes other circumstances get in my way, like my feet (actually more like foot) going bust. The other thing is weightloss, I've been doing it a few times now. The first real approach was when I reached 1st stage of obesity, rated at 97 kg, I went low-fat and after seeing just -2kg in a month, I got a niff of keto from an averagedly old, sort of internet, friend of mine (I made friends in some weird ways in the past). I took a hardcore version of this, cutting calories even as low as 60% I believe or even more. Doing this for 4 weeks, I got down to 82, that's a whooping 15 kg, crazy shit. I did other runs and in the end I managed reaching max 73.5 with the goal usually set between 75-72. I really wanted to reach 72 but I never managed to get that and having such fails usually tend to get a bit under my skin, just a tinny bit but it still feels as if there was always a chance and wasted chances always hurt. This year I managed to drill through 7 weeks of keto and I managed to get down to 73.9, after I gained a bit of weight from my first studio uni course. I kind of bounced back in a month or a bit over this period but now since I really have lots of free time at hand, I feel there is nothing really stopping me from reaching this value of 72. I understand that I will most likely bounce back to 75 after getting out of keto but I can schedule all of this and so far I'm 5 weeks in, so on a path to break another record, although got into the state of stalling for a while at ~76 kg. Hold your thumbs for me y'all, although at this ketofairbakery place I was told I was skinny, I'm still sort of hellbent on reaching this 72 kg, because I just want to and I believe that's the sweet spot for me.

    Sometimes, I just am like this and feel like achieving something in particular. It hurts when it doesn't work out, especially if it's really something I really really wanted and felt that would be particularly.. hm... just that I as a person needed. There were lots of fails in my past and each larger win gets me in a good mood for at least a few weeks. And it definitely makes you think that, well, you got something good going. It's really a fantastic feeling. Truly.

  After writing a bit of blogs, when I set my mind to it, at times I kind of require a bit of a refresher. I like to do stuff in streaks, preferably longer ones. But after some time passes, I'm kind of depleted of my material and you know I gotta come up with stuff that I figure I forgot to mention or that I find interesting and I'd like to cover. It doesn't usually work out straightaway but there are ways that I need to kill time with and sometimes, even despite I have all the stuff laid out for me on the platter, I might just not end up touching it for a variety of reasons. For instance, since Saturday I've been kind of holed up at home with headaches and sleeping like crazy. I kind of think it's got something to do with the cakes but who knows, it's a weird guess. I'm still passing on hundreds of processed gigabytes onto my hard drive, which is slowly approaching the almost 8 TB limit. I rediscovered that I need a couple of David Fincher movies to catch up on. Some stuff I kinda like that I've seen in a few days some stuff not so much. I still have a couple of things to take care of but I'm pushing back executing it all till, well, later I guess.

    How is it, that with each movie that's based in New York I get exactly the same feeling of New York as it were, being crazy crazy and feeling this sort of an awe and feeling like I wanna go back.
