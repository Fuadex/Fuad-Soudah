  There is lots of vegetation actually in my area. I started noticing it vanishing, especially next to my street which I found to be a very unpleasant surprise once I got back from New York. Such a funny realization, especially knowing how New York was a concrete state, that actually blooms throughout Summer. And as I can, at times, focus on the negatives, the grandparents do have a rose plantation and my mom has been keeping some vegetation, next to the house, on the balcony, and where she lives. It's kind of becoming a little Italy here. Or Japan. Or France? Or, perhaps it's just Poland...
</p>

    <p>
      I was wondering for a long time how will I react, returning from New York to places that I have spent such a long time in. Australia, perhaps less but Europe, Germany, Poland. Especially the last in the sequence, as this remains as the country in which I have objectively as of yet spent the longest time. Australia is a bit behind by about 3-4 years. That's still not much, also objectively.</p>

      I wake up early. The rays are barging into my room and I hear birds. An entire accolade streaming outside my window. I open, sliding the frame angularly and getting a niff of fresh air, the same I could have sworn I kept slightly inclined before hitting the deck the night before. Hitting the deck perhaps is not a good way of putting a bed. In the end, it's a nice thing to have, you start to miss it once you're in motion between places. I don't even know what actually gets me up so early in the morning, is it the light brazing through the curtains. And then I recall this one comment on facebook, in which a random person said, someone else to be very lucky to live in an area where they hear birds outside their window. And you know how right they are and how you appreciate to wake up to all this phantasm and the trees climbing far up. Right below the high-voltage powerline that crossing right over my grandparents' land. But also, as artificial powerlines are and how nicely they do their zzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz sound when it rains, birds also enjoy socializing on those, preferably in the morning, doing their thing and putting my ears into a kind of, pleasantness. That eventually goes away, with the first worker showing up for work right next to the place I live.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had such grand plans for my stay here. See the rest of Europe! I mean, there are quite a few places I have not been to and there is so little time left in my youth as I see it. Taking a break. Enjoying my time. Developing and evolving some of my skills. The new, old and some others I was yet to learn, as I wanted to. Helping out around, not caring about much.</p>

<p>And what it came down to, was me. Waking up to the birds singing and the rays piercing. Opening the window in a tragically, so badly ventilated room, that I'd end up waking up even with a headache. Dust coming around. Allergies kicking in. Me, withdrawing, to checking facebook. And scrolling, checking news, scrolling. This, me, doing for hours. Then on my laptop, the same thing. Knowing, of my plans and all but being withheld by, the grand distances I'd have to sway away to. And the limited bandwidth I had on my internet and how unstable it is. And then also all the thoughts and things hitting my head, and my family not giving me any slack, turning this all into a yet natural but so unnatural limbo. I'm sad to go now. But I also know I won't grow if I don't get out now.

      Cutting in to the end, I'll break it to you all, I'm finding it average. It comes as a surprise to me, on one hand I have known it is a place that plays on and with my senses, practically any time I set my foot on this land. But it's always somehow been skewed one way or another, most of the time with me being tired or tired by being depressed and just in need of something directly familiar to which I could relate. But after spending about 4 months in new york and imbuing myself into this, while still calling it craziness, with all its mad and holy under, there was a lot that was actually incredibly and surprisingly good. In the sea of paradoxes, I think the lack of stability and even more of the individualism of the one anyone would think as of being lesser and again paradoxically the quality of many products just simply lacking, I'm kind of beginning to think there is no future for me here. And I'm saying these words as something absolutely certain, I also managed to continue an amazing streak in all my previous years. Exponentially eye-opening, certainly one-of-a-kind that is just simply almost impossible to replicate by a person of an alike status like myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yet, here I am. Sitting on my bed in this 10 square meters large room. I put in a desk here, surprisingly, by telling myself I need a space to work at. My mom didn't like the way I positioned the desk, as the desk would be positioned so that I could keep an eye on my door. In a way she was right, having a bed and a desk positioned horizontally right next to each other was a terrible idea. Terrible use of space, terrible idea to mix a sleeping space and a working space altogether. Especially, that I didn't have internet at home so I used my phone. Especially that the internet would not reach my home in terrific fashion, so I'd need to juggle between how many gigabytes I'd have (usually a lot) and the speed and latency of it. And then figuring out what I would be really doing with it all. With the noise coming from the industrial part of my uncle's warehouse, I'd wake up relatively early in the morning. And dazzled by the taste of my friend's yerba mate I'd decide to go ahead and make my own, as I needed to keep myself alive and do some work, cause New York was still not yet out of me and I had to keep myself going. Not minding the noise next door, with my customs in my ears, listening to whatever magic I'd turn myself to, I'd succumb into the act of working on whatever I'd be willing to work on. With an earthernware cup/mug, a straw and freshly brewed yerba mate, recurrently, usually about 5-7 times on the same run and as I'd rage through the work I'd eventually start minding, how uncomfortable the chair I was sitting on was, how the desk was unsuitable for working on, with not the right height and my mouse not behaving properly. If I'd hit the bed, I'd again be unhappy with how it was not perfectly fitting in this room and I could not sit and work or lay down and work properly. At this point, I'd start reminiscensing Australia but then I'd be like... I don't wanna go back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final days were not that different, really. I'd get some food downstairs, usually too much. I'd keep an eye on what I was eating and be in pain that it all was too much. And it was, after over a month of settling in, from a reinforced guy who used to power on salads consisting primarily of meats, energybombs alike Arizona teas and Pocari Sweat, muscled up I'd go up and down, down by muscles, up by fat, all the way to 85, which I was not happy with. But that's what you get for running on beers and food that, again surprinsingly, was just not really as healthy as what I would keep myself going on... in the states.

  Parting ways with Poland wasn't easy, again, because I didn't want to go back to Australia. The primarily blockade preventing me from going back was going back to a larger room, a better equipped environment and less stringent environment. In theory better food, healthier air, fruits that were actually fresher and tastier and.. Jesus, am I describing some form of masochism here? As if I didn't want to go back to a better place on purpose? But see, some people in the nordic countries, tales say, they commit crimes just do that they can end up in prison, because they don't have to pay for rent. And the place is literally like a holiday, where you go playing volleyball with prison guards. Play playstation 3, have food from morning till evening. Now, except, in Australia I wouldn't have prison guards to play with. I wouldn't even play volleyball with anyone. If I wanted, I'd need to travel for larger amounts of time and... that wasn't that different from Poland again. To get anywhere near Warsaw, I'd need to make my way up there, taking a train that would usually be late. And getting up there would take a larger amount of time compared to me taking a bicycle up to 14th street on Manhattan. Crazy right? Sydney of all was the worst, though, 1.5h of commute. Fuck this. There's nothing in Minto and yet, over the course of years, I mean...
</p>

<p>
  You know what, I mean people work and probably have the same kind of a lifestyle I shouldn't complain as much but at the same time, I do, because I recalibrate my life to getting work done at the University. I pour my heart out, I get burnt out, I do a lot to make sure that I learn as much as possible and so as much as possible and I get successful but with coming years, I feel that there is something that does not quite oil the cogs and the machine doesn't really end up anywhere.
</p>

<p>
  I mean, you could think that having a life where you get fed, have a roof under which you can sleep and a good university to attend is not so bad of a life after all but I never yearned for a life to live on a stalemate. I always wanted to go out in the world and try my best in achieving something. But it's as if logs of wood keep being thrown under my feet and as I fall, I hit the deck and the restart button, with more experience on my back but kind of nowhere that I've ended up in. And I blame lots, including myself but I keep trying to get that repaired. Not always with success.

      I think this blog was supposed to be about my departure primarily. But the thing is, not that much really revolved about the departure per say. I had a flight in the evening so I was chill. I didn't pack until the very last hours actually. My mom as usual does not like to part ways with me, as usual she's overly protective and I really hate that, as if her decisions concerning me were ever purely rational and dictated by my wellbeing. I said goodbye to my grandpa, who at the age of 88 still works and regularly drives tens of kilometers to sell roses in Warsaw. My grandma seems a bit changed lately and in need of contact of her children and grandchildren, all in all they all seemed very warm and welcoming, which is very nice to feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      But overall, I think I left too much of a baggage back there. I don't quite feel exactly welcome by a number parties, which is a bit astounding on my part. On one hand I do but on the other, I realise everyone has their own lives to live and, I'm kind of one of the not that many left, that kind of doesn't have a life of his own just yet. In theory I was coming back to Australia to kind of finish what I've started, my Master's n' all but with all the complications I was having at that time, it remains to be seen whether this will result to anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, despite I had a very colorful trip back home, again put together last minute and hastily, making sure that I keep the costs down and see as much as possible, I guess I managed to do just that but I didn't feel like going at all anywhere at all. And yet, I put myself in this airplane with my first stop coming up - Helsinki, an overnight stay.
    </p>

        <p>
      It was a bit crazy honestly. The connection I put myself up for was Warsaw-Helsinki-Delhi-Colombo-Mali-Kuala Lumpur-Sydney. It feels as if I keep raising the bar for myself and trying to find out when I will really eventually fuck up, as with each stop I'd have a lot of time to wander around. Like in Helsinki, for instance, freaking 20 hours. What the fuck would I be doing there for 20 hours, as I've already been to Helsinki once? Well.. I was about to find out and I didn't even research that much for once.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I also discovered it would be raining at every single destination I would be going through. And that was ultimately fucked.
