      Ahh... the pleasure of sipping a freshly brewed cup of coffee. The pleasure ain't always the same, having it prepared following the modern-standard rituals is the key along with having the beans from selected origin grounded on the site, roasted on the site even beforehand, all of those right before you treat it with an aeropress, v60 or chemex. A simple machine could do too, actually. But there's also the temperature and...
</p>

<p>
  Ah, what am I saying, as if I'm a specialist in these regards. All I can do is, drink a cup of coffee and tell, whether it's good or bad and to some degree what I taste in it.
</p>

<p>
  Yeees... what does it have in connection with Lithuania you may ask?

  <center><h4>A note to self</h4></center>
    <br>

    <p>
      My forms of... well... one might say vices, as the entire concept extends probably onto what I eat and what I drink, alcohol-wise, all of these have radically shifted in the scope of last... I don't know, let's frame it within 5 years, that's when most of the changes occcurred in my life. I mean, what I would eat, what I would consider as good to eat, what I'd consider as healthy, or the right amounts, the new types of foods and herbs, and everything. Bit by bit, these all shift around. Only at home in Poland these would rather stand firm (although they'd shift a bit too) and back in Australia, where all of it would, hm, be kinda the same. Up to the point I'd go on a diet, then it'd be the same but without the carbs, steaks and spinach, and avocado. Not that I hate this combo and that it is unhealthy but at some point you're like: is there anything else to eat on keto? I'm staaarviiiiing (well, not quite, not on keto but yeah).
    </p>

    <p>
      In case of stimulants, I'd stick to whatever's legal legal. I mean, some might even call alcohol a stimulant, despite it being classified as a depressant (interestingly). But, ya know, there's coffee, tea and... uh. Let's start from those. Ya know, Lipton tea, flavored teas, loose leaf teas, most of them I'd probably drink strong (unless in teabags) and black, not that often green. I didn't know as much about the right temperature at the time. I'd shift to coffee, instant, then the powdered (as in, grounded). There was not that much I could do with beans, so these I wouldn't get. And then everything started to shift, once I discovered a bit more teas on the market in Australia. Like, types of green tea, wow! T2 isn's that good of a brand, though. And once I was back in Poland, I'd get a niff of cacao, which seemed to be a decent alternative, except I don't often drink milk! I'd go back to Australia and discover that some people queuing up at this coffee branch, is a bit suspicious. And so it was, I mean they had great salads and rolls but once I tried the coffee I was like - 'Ha! That's different! As if, not burnt altogether?'. And then I learned why some folks would head to Toby's Estate a bit further down the road to get a cup. And I'd get a single origin drip in Copenhagen, which was one of the best coffee drips I've ever had with the beans all the way from Kenya! Although, Korea blew my mind literally, with a small branch that roasted on the spot and as a whole was the best place that I've stumbled upon, ever. The owner would come around and offer free refills! Holy shit! Although this blend, this simple Americano I bought for 2000 KRW, which started so innocently with increasing notes of anise/liquorish, with the mid becoming a bit more fruity, was that, at the time, grapefruity? Damn... and it finished with an (over)tone of mint. Best coffee of my life. Still, I'd shift left and get myself into drinking mate, can't figure out what really suggested me to do so at the time, perhaps the Club-Mate drinks I found on the market 5 years back and how regular type provided a solid but rather different kick. Then my friend a shorter while back introduced me to the ritual of drinking mate, with a matero and a filter and I got into this and broke my matero on my way up north. I was also suggested to look into guarana... And there was something else too. In case of teas, there's lots good ones too, green primarily would make me relaxed. Still don't know a good white tea, oolong does't do a thing, red I don't know much etc. etc. etc. It's a nice world to venture through, honestly. Interesting too.

      So how is it, that in Warsaw, in the very center I cannot manage of finding a local, just simply, local cafe. All of them, chains. Not just chains, these chains offer at-most average cup of coffee. Sure, they have snacks, bagels, cakes but if you go into a cafe, you want a coffee. Preferably, a good cup of coffee. I found it impossible to find one! What's ridiculous, is that near where I live, apparently there is coffee roaster, I never discovered it until I started scanning what's near me. Because, I started finding some pearls near where I live(d) in Poland.
    </p>

    <p>
      And, ya know. In Vilnius, at some point we were like, I need a cup of coffee. We need a cup of coffee. And we looked into the map and it showed... as if, all the... the average rating all verged between 4.6 and 4.8 out of 5. Most of what popped up on my screen, seemed just simply local. Offerring drips, roasted coffee on the spot etc. etc. We picked just one place that was on our way from the park, on our way from the hill with the 3 crosses. A clean, modern, near all-white place. A few cakes, a pair operating the branch. A friend asked for a cappuccino, I asked for a chemex... I think I went for the most expensive option, as there were: aeropress, v60 and chemex. The guy asked what type of beans would I like and he recommended between two types from Kenya by enabling us to smell the beans. I chose, upon getting a recommendation from my friend, one that smelled a bit as if more fruity. It took a few whiles for him to prepare the brew and upon providing it, he said to wait a few minutes so that it settles. I waited, a bit less and then I poured myself and a bit for my friend, there was enough for like 3 cups all-in-all. Yeah, it tasted hazelnutty, although the finish was fruity. Still, that was a very good brew. I think it cost something like, 3.5 Euros? Definitely worth it, along with the cake slice with a blueberry on top.

      We had to evacuate shortly to get some beers, as in Lithuania you have some barbaric laws enforced, like you cannot buy alcohol after 8. Wtf. On Sundays, I think we heard like 3 o'clock and the minimum drinking age is like 20. We went out in quick search of a place but the two we went to, almost running, one was not-to-be-found, the other one - clearly closed. Then something struck me - shit, you can buy alcohol at supermarkets all-in-all. So, we went empty-handed. We got what we wanted the next day. The reason for why I'm depicting this entire charade with coffee, I mean think about it. You can get a really good cup of coffee, at a good price, nearly anywhere around Vilnius! Cups are more expensive at chains in Warsaw and they don't even taste (often that) good. Perhaps it is also a domain of smaller-scale cities. But I've been to larger that had a more robust culture centred around those. Also, their English was great. Interior Design of the place we've been to, real slick robust. The one eatery we went into was a bit expensive in Užupis. Apparently World Heritige Site, also one area that tried carving itself out from the country itself, more or less. I guess there are more Christiania areas located around the world that we don't quite know and it's fun to learn about. An area a bit differentiated from Vilnius itself, all-in-all. A bit artsy too. And a bit deeper into it, with quite nice architecture and just the normal everyday life carried out by its dwellers. Ok, I got a bit lost here.

  This is even more annoying, as such 'pavements created for both pedestrians and cyclists' are useless for some other people. Now there scooters running around Warsaw, these guys are robust and are electrical so perhaps it is relatively okay to use those for sidewalks. But let's take a non-electrical type. There is really no pleasure in driving one around and needing to kick off every 5 seconds to keep your thing running. And then you have roller skates and roller blades, which will absolutely be utterly useless on paved walkways. These would be good or cyclepaths that are made out of asphalt or concrete or a mix between (from what I know, concrete is best all the way with the least friction). But that won't be the case if the cyclepaths are made out of bricks! I can see somepoint to getting such done in such manner, at least to well raise just a well, wider footpath. One that is at least 2.5 meters wide is suitable for cyclists and voila, due to the legislation, yes, cyclists can legally ride through and so they call it a pedestrian-cyclists footpath. It's just, I have been recently to Germany and despite some cities may seem a bit rundown like Berlin, from what I've seen so far, in most the cyclepaths are actually done properly. Asphalt. For most of the cases. If not, there will often be a seperate line on the street for cyclist to roam through. It's ofen made in a way to not become quite annoying for pedestrians too, as in the line will often go along the street or be positioned on an elevated level along the street so that cars can't go over it. The paths will also be constructed in a way that they will often just be straight. This sounds almost like a pleonasm here, I mean this is obvious that streets should go straight, right? Well, here in Poland, whenever an intersection I see too often cases where the the cyclepath will do a bit of a slight detour, making it impossible to pass an intersection just by going pure straight crossing the intersection. At times it is done so unnaturally, that you may think it's literally just an extension for cars, which it is obviously not. I also see now that there is some sort of other madness happening in Warsaw currently, where they put asphalt cyclepaths on larger swaths of pavements but they put it right in the middle of it all. Pedestrians have priority all of the time so even if a cyclist bumps into one, the cyclist ought to be liable but they often won't care as long as they're on it. This makes it bad for such pedestrians, as in these key points to which I'm pointing too are often attended by larger groups of people, let's say for coming on and off the tram, bus or the metro. In such case, the cyclepaths ought to be designed in a way that will not be bothersome for pedestrians but they cut through those key points nowadays. Another seperate case I see is one Park & Ride area, which they have revitilised (Aleja Wilanowska). There are a few huge problems with how they have done it. First of all, there is no direct connection for pedestrians from metro to the 'bus knot'. You need to pass through a street and often by a few parked cars in an unlawful way. Everyone does this. Not to mention there is a carpark positioned right in between the bus terminal and the subway. In addition, they have made an additional zebra crossing at the beginning of one lane at the terminal. One that is extremely frequently attended by buses which often leads to confusion between people and bus drivers alike, at times it will not be the first bus in line that will be departing but the second due to the buses not lining up properly, due to the crossing made at the beginning of it. Not to mention it is kinda dangerous for it to be there in the first place, take it anyone is driving it, they can't see anybody popping up all of a sudden. All this may sound abstract but it's all the bits and pieces, just who the fuck designs this city in the first place?
</p>

<p>
  I am also often a bit afraid of walking along the street to. I live by a street that does not have any pavements for pedestrians, the only way to move along it is by moving along the street but by remaining on the street. The streets are often narrow, all around Poland in fact, often allowing perhaps two cars to pass by simultaneously but it is not always the case. There are streets which even lack roadsides and the drivers often do not care, speeding often centimeters by you. I don't want to point out the lack of skills on the drivers' side but even the slightest mistake will lead to a fatal case. I felt much safer in, actually, every single country I've been to so far. Sure, you get crazy drivers in Australia but with the infrastructure being a bit Americanised in the suburbs, where the roads are ridiculously wide, you'd need to deliberately drive into someone to lead to an accident. All that just makes venturing from point A to B very bothersome. I don't mind walking kilometers to get somewhere (although I'm starting to feel eerie about the time I spend doing so) but if it's just not feeling okay for some reason to do so, I'm starting to have second thoughts. I think due to this back in the past I often leaned towards returning back home from a party by bike, whatever condition I was in. To feel much safer to travel back by this method than by foot, I feel, illustrates just how bad it is.
</p>

<p>
  Then there is the public transport about which I was feeling it was pretty actually good here in Warsaw. Modern, good fleet, quite regular services, affordable tickets (for students at least, all kind). Often there is wifi, now even usb hubs. You may buy tickets in a ticket machine within many of the buses. But once 35 degrees started hitting the entire country, somehow I ended up often in a bus, train, tram, even metro without proper AC. It was just extremely bad and now that I look back, I think in any country I've been to that experiences extreme weather, the AC just works well, say Sydney, Montreal, Munich. I'm surprised it's that bad here and the fleet that Warsaw has at its disposal, seems a bit rundown actually now. It hasn't been long since they have equipped themselves with all those brand new buses and they're at such state already? Wifi often does not work on trains. Also, AC doesn't either. There are quite frequent delays and some of the timetables are fucked, with no train arriving for a bit over an hour and then two arriving consecuitively one after the other by literally just a few minutes. The last train back to where I live seems to depart from Warsaw about at 11:30 PM. The tickets sold at the trains also do not seem to carry much sense, as it works in segments but there is no logic in them. At times, you may end up paying the same amount for slightly longer routes and they are priced in a weird way up to the cent, which makes it just a hassle for both customers and the conductor. Some ticket machines also work in a strange way. Some will not have the screen bright enough for you to buy a ticket in full-sun. Some will carry on with errors. Say you need 5 tickets, the ticket machine will often need 5-10 seconds to dispense a ticket each. I gotta say these systems are designed quite well but there are some areas where they just need improving. Payment usually is seamless, though. But they also introduced a few ways to pay, at times you will get a plastic ticket with which you may enter a metro only from one side, which is just simply not clear (especially where to put the ticket to get the QR scanned, not all people know what a QR code is). The newer gates established at the second line of metro look bad, as if already rundown and you cannot just walk quickly, pass through as the gates open lazilly. The realtime departure screens often are misleading, the public transport does seem to have some problems with arriving on time, although that's not necessarily bad compared to any other country in fact. The only problem is, that in any other country, the connections seem to arrive more often, which makes it less of a pain to travel around. I especially have much against the train connections, which are illogically constructed, do not come through often enough and stop running too early. Changing buses from my area is a pain as well.

    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      All in all, Warsaw seems to be constructed for cars primarilly, although it's not quite. As there is a hyperinflation of road signs. I'm not joking, there are so many. So so many, on one road you may come across about 50 in ridiculous cases. It is simply impossible to keep track of all, for drivers. If there were driverless cars running around, the system fueling it all would have to be so robust to take under consideration it all. But to calculate how to behave in which situation, I believe could lead to paradoxes where the cars, if I was an AI, I would probably just refuse to carry on. I swear, with such large swaths of signs, there must be contradictions in place. From what I recall, there are also cases where some solutions made for cars are also illogical, where you need to change lanes to keep going forward. The streets also seem to be too strongly curved, which makes it just at times even dangerous from drivers themselves to keep in lanes and not cross onto others going the same way. I feel there is also not sufficiently enough of over- and underpasses. There is a weird tendency to get the pedestrian traffic onto the streets, rather than hide them below or get them up. This leads to interesting paradoxes, where some underpasses became closed due to this policy. In some areas, pedestrians have to walk up a few stories and walk down so they can get to a train platform 'safely'. Many refuse to do so, crossing the traintracks straight, which I do not blame them for. Even in order to connect to trams or any other forms, they have to do so, which again makes it extremely hassling. In some cities they made it logical, for instance in Cracow where is it quite straightforward to move around as a pedestrian from key areas (although some connections seem weird and confusing). The connection between the only two metrolines in Poland (in Warsaw) are too narrow and there are no signs that I could spot that show that yeah, you may change right there. Some interchanges are just made without taking under consideration the people, hence, just badly designed. That goes for each, local and a bit more global solutions such as railways. All of a sudden, they seemed to have turned off all the ticket machines for in-country connections. And there are always queues that take at times tens of minutes to get what you need. Also, there are not enough train ticket machines for a specific type of suburban rail (koleje mazowieckie). The pricing scheme for rail is also a bit confusing, as it does not seem to take under consideration how many people have booked the train. Every single robust system that I know, seems to entice customers to make reservations early, the first tickets usually go at heavily discounted prices. You may get a ticket at long-distance trains at Deutsch Bahn for as low as 19 Euros but if you make the reservation with the train a bit more full, the price will skyrocket to over 100 Euros per connection. In Poland, the prices seem to be fixed, which is somewhat good for me, as students get 51% off. My situation is especially interesting, as I fall into the category, where 'a student who is taking his studies overseas, is under 26 and is a Polish citizen is eligible for student pricing'. I really wonder how the fuck did this line get in the state legislation, if it wasn't for some politician's son or daughter taking studies overseas and somehow making their lives easier. It kind of reminds me of these cases where the stench of corruption just seems a bit too much, where public offerings took only under consideration very specific types of whatever they were looking for, for which surprisingly only one type of whatever they were looking for (let's say cars) only fell into the category. Well, I get to take advantage of this so far but my main point lays elsewhere: the state train carrier does not seem to have a good pricing system. It seems to have started to change as at times you could get from point A to B at roughly the same time by taking a different type of train, with in theory a worse standard of service but in fact it was superior by at least having wifi onboard... which the premium service does not have. In which they serve a cup of tea... which is not necessarily a very good cup, with lots of rubbish that could be avoided (lots of plastic). It's just I see a lot of the shortsightness in all of the solutions being introduced around the country. It's not something particularly new, it's been like this for quite a while now also during the preceding governments. I just had a view of the country as being a bit more modern, compared to some other environments overseas. But there seem to be a lot of cracks in it.

      I'm also having a feel of chaos happening in terms of the services around Poland. Back in the days I was quite impressed by how the competition was fierce in terms of groceries, telecommunication etc. The prices generally were low and the quality of service very high. But that seemed to have ruptured. In case of groceries it is still the case but the prices have hiked quite substantially. You may buy really good quality products pretty much anywhere but it's a bit unclear to me how I manage to spend just simply too much and why such products tend to vary in case of prices substantially from one shop to the other. Some shops seemed to have gone a bit silent like the ladybird chain, as they made an attempt to target customers looking for a bit more premium range of products (so did many other chains). Many shops seemed to have rearranged a lot: their interiors, not necessarily becoming ultimately better, as in they have introduced a lot of clutter with the same types of products being offered at seperate alleys around the shop. Telecommunication websites seem cluttered, it really pains me to see prices depicted as let's say 69.99 instead of 70. When you see so many 9.99 everywhere, your head starts to ache. And the terms at times seem vague. I went to Liechtenstein once where roaming was supposed to cover the area. Once I crossed the border between Austria and Liechtenstein, suddenly my internet packages didn't seem to budge. I was left without any internet for the remainder of my trip and the next day I consulted the consultant, he said everything was done properly and according to the rules and that it's my device's fault for connecting to Switzerland (which is anywhere between 3-5 km away from Austrian and so Liechtenstein's borders). The consultant wasn't too nice about it but once I filed in a complaint, I did get it honored. Still, there is a lot of confusion going on in relation to whether I can do this or that and whether there are no landmines laid across the field, just so that you don't stumble into one and get yourself blown into the moon. It just seems as if a lot of the service providers seek to milk the customers as much as they, it feels worse than the states where the entire systems seems to be rigged to milk the citizens all the time, although they know exactly how much they will be milked for. This is not quite the case here in Poland. The element of uncertainty is just a bit too much, this unfortunately extends to enterpreneurs themselves, who get milked from the government at times for no reason. Service often takes a longer time compared to the west and is underwhelming, unfortunately.

      This all creates an unheathly circle social-wise. Creates walls, which actually entire communities also do. Gated communities, which remain open in many other for instance Netherlands, in Germany too. But here, every single developed cluster of homes seem to need an entire system to keep outsiders out. Perhaps it gets to do also something about how the infrastructure is constructed, as many local roads in, say Australia, kind of lead towards nowhere, serving just primarily the local needs of whoever needs to commute from the dead end. It worked a bit on my nerves while I lived in Aussie but I see the point quite clearly. I believe more roads around here ought to be closed from one end to serve only the local community and therefore try to pedestrianise the streets (open it up for cyclists too). There are not enough parks either. Lots of dust being generated by cars. Newly built pavements often have a lot of sand remaining after the development. Munich was an amazing city in terms of how the gigantic parks were beautifully interconnected with each other and put along rivers with large treets climbing up. These areas usually were just simply quiet, with lots of birds chirping and at times people passing by either by foot or bike. In Warsaw, it's just a mess. I miss also seeing large trees by the streets. Even New Yorks has those. At sleep during winter but blooming beautifully early summer. Keeping the temperature low, making each stroll a nice experience. Perhaps Warsaw still needs sometime to mature and see that having green areas and less concrete is the way to go.

      I also have some reservations in relation to the cuisine and quality of foods in general. I was surprised to see I can't find a good cup of coffee near the city center. It was all primarily chains, there is at least one really good with fantastic interior design but not necessarily good cup of coffee, though. New York was prevalently great all over with local chains serving fantastic coffee. Korea was amazing with local cafes. Montreal surprised me, even when I went into a very traditional place, where I was served a cup of coffee, I expected at best a neutral-tasting cup. And it was but somehow it had a bit of hazelutty notes and a bit citrusy finish. This was a good cup. I can't find any here. They sell a good roast quite close to where I live, which I should buy any day now but no cafe that I do know unfortunately. I went to try some Korean food, which didn't impress me with the service of sides and the flavour itself. I did manage to eat a fantastic burger. The food culture is certainly developing and catching up to the west with more and more interesting places coming into my radar but it's they all seem to lack here or there and come at a hefty at times price range. There often are exceptions, though. I find it often that locals are a bit more conscious in relation to what they do and eat and that's great to see.

      Now that is a big highlight for me, the people I am coming across quite often in my path here. I have a bit of problem with this, as for my first three weeks I have spent meeting with friends. When I do so, it's usually by a few beers. At times, there is more alcohol and that makes it a bit problematic for me to carry on from day to day. And I also seem a bit braindead but despite it all, the conversations I engage with or hear seem to be insightful, constructive and touch upon some really interesting topics. There is a lot of light shed from a variety of quite specialistic perspectives and I hear quite authentic and rich stories. Also just the pleasantness of many of the people I come across is really nice, in ways also the liveliness. I also see that in many cases, people who study here are just simply better in terms of the work they do compared to many of the western schools I have come across. At times, they are crazily good. I'll put a seperate post on this one day. I was extremely impressed by many of the works created by the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. With the concept, execution conducted flawlessly and so many different styles that I have seen in many cases.

      I also see now that I am here, that it's been pretty much 5 years now. And since then many people have moved on. Having kids, establishing families. Working, working. Carrying on with life. And I'm kinda in the middle of nowhere, pushing forward but somehow something somewhere, all missing and not quite making sense, putting me in a sense of a deep void from which I don't know where to move and head towards. Now this is not nice and frankly depressing which changes only when I start moving again or working meaningfully, which I often don't get to do.
