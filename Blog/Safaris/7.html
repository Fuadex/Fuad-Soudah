    <p>
So as scheduled, one of the first things we have done, was AEIOU. Even before that, I noticed, that somehow this technique is strongly related to, well, ethograms. And considering the weather situation at the Zoo on the given day, I decided to do a workaround and create a 360 timelapse of one of the species that was present at the zoo itself.
</p>

<p>
  Which species may you ask? Well. Good you asked. Cause there were a few at the Zoo and one that I figured would be cool looking into, was, well, were Pandas. But not the big black white asian superheroes, that love to cuddle, love bamboo and are just supercool and destroy racism, cause they're pandas. These pandas were tree pandas, pandas that hop between trees, are smaller, much thinner, just as lazy or even lazier and they are red. But that's not the name of it now, is it? It's called - red panda! And it's an amazingly stunning panda, so cute that your eyeballs fly out of the orbit and you'd just love to cuddle one (but I don't think it would like to be cuddled though).
</p>

<p>
So, the question is, if I did not do an ethogram due to the bad weather conditions, so how could I do AEIOU? Well, I have some jokers up my sleeve and so I recorded this beauty of an animal with a timelapse for a duration of over 30 minutes. I have taken also pictures and a few video shots just in case. These had to be post-processed and then I rewatched them all and came up with what the pandas were doing - and they were not doing much. One was walking, the other was sleeping. There were some minor variations that occured as a result of this process but, the endgame was this: I had an ethogram, in fact observations, based on which I devised ethograms, based on which I could complete AEIOU.

</p>

<p>
Lengthy process but it did bear fruit.

  By augmenting the environment, there are a few things that I aim at achieving: introducing a new, unfamiliar environment to the animal by introducting a set of new visuals and auditory cues, along with perhaps adjusted temperature and humidity to emulate the environment. While with such a setting it would certainly be possible to augment a reality centered around humans, as they have developed a range of devices set for the purpose of themselves, to the extent of even calibrating all the machinery to imitate the exact representation of audiovisual environments perceived by humans or even augmenting them, I would expect to have such an environment not work appropriately at least straightaway perhaps just due to the fact of how the senses vary between the species. Nevertheless, I wonder if wallabies would feel comfortable to spend time at an environment that would resemble tropical forests and now while tammar wallabies can't survive when it's over 40 degrees Centigrade (and rendering such environments with temperature and humidity would certainly be have no sense and be expensive), perhaps they may become comfortable if it's just the forest itself, with appropriate sounds elicited by other animals and the temperature just appropriate for them. Or even environments resembling the north pole, perhaps not due to the representation of the north pole itself but perhaps just the set of visual cues of white and blue could appeal to them, rendering a new appropriate environment for them to rest at and spend time.
</p>

<p>
  While I understand such an environment cannot be provided as a substitute to an actual, natural environment and the fidelity of the projection will never be of absolutely sufficient quality due to shadows generated by moving objects such as kangaroos themselves and just the resolution is not going to be ever appropriate. Nevertheless, it might be the case, that for kangaroos/wallabies/wallaroos who are not familiar with such new environments, may actually become interested. These particular species need to migrate (depending on the kangaroos, could go up to tens of kilometers of search for food) and so they need to be able to adapt to a variety of environments. I also think, many people like to travel. Some animals do travel for the purpose of their survival, think - many different birds, which will fly seasonally at times for thousands of kilometers. Perhaps kangaroos do not quite do that, certainly not wallabies but perhaps, despite there might not be one specific evolutionary benefit for them, they still may find some usecase of liking in such (environments) and hence, potentially lead to enriching their lives, in the end defining what enrichment is remains as a quite difficult task in term of refering that term to animals, especially wild and those placed in enclosures.

  There are some issues that I foresee nevertheless, especially in terms of Tammar Wallabies in particular. They are apparently nocturnal species, although many of their activities will take place during the same, some will take place during the night. Projecting dark environments is a particularly difficult task, as long as I know, that is hardly possible due to a projection mapping, well, being literally projection of light. There are probably some ways to alleviate that issue, perhaps it might be possible to just render some environments in grayscale and by that, giving an impression of an environment that is explored during the night. There is also the question whether wallabies would perceive the environment as one that really differs based on different projections mapped. Perhaps physical changes to the environment would be necessary by the introduction of specific leaves, grass, ground and other props to truly enhance the potentially enriching experience. Although, naturally such augmentations have been already portrayed in the mass media, at times in quite gloomy way such as in Black Mirror but they are also still being experimented on in forms of prototypes for enrichment of human lives. Still, seeing the potential problems with such solutions should not be overlooked.

  For the purpose of the prototype I created a few environments, that could give an idea of how the prototype could potentially work. In real world, it would not be that immersive that you would see so far outside, although potentially that could be simulated in a few ways by changing the actual 'dome' environment, perhaps involving a few projectors instead of a system of prisms and mirrors. Nevertheless, the combination of audiovisual cues kept at a fidelity enough to keep, potentially, a wallaby immersed within the space to perhaps interact with other wallabies and or rest, first of all generate interest and see how it reacts, whether it likes it or not. This could lead to an idea that what I am trying to achieve is to perhaps introduce a toy of sorts which I'd argue against, as what I'm trying to do is simulate an environment that would be otherwise just difficult to introduce, pretty much as humans do for augmenting their own reality and introducing a mixed reality systems of their own (I should have used this term probably from the very beginning, although with so many different realities existing even I found myself quite lost).

  I introduced three conceptual environments: arctic, subtropical and temperate.

  Following up on Harpreet's proposed source of postdoctoral research conducted at University of Melbourne by Sarah Webber, in line with the mixed reality idea suggested for Enrichment II for Design in Safaris, I read into the details of how mixed reality was introduced to Orangutans. This is almost exactly what I am proposing, although at a limited degree and for non-human species that are very closely related to humans themselves, which seems to entail a focus on interaction and having the technologies introduced at limited capacity as opposed to Enrichment II idea of turning an entire room into a rather static, yet still mixed reality environment. At this point, I have a hunch that introducing dynamic elements into the place will generate natural anxiety in animals, triggering a fight or flight response, which may be different for those kept in enclosures. Although at this point I assume all animals kepts at Zoos are in fact wild animals, non-domesticated.
</p>

<p>
  Related work could include Koko, which (it feels weird by saying it but I guess you could call it a lifelong) project in which a Gorilla was raised, technically by a human and taught as much as thought best in terms of how to communicate, primarily by the use of sign language. I believe in terms of cognitive capabilities these species are related, to humans as well and therefore more aware and as showcased during one of the lectures, they can exceed in certain tasks compared to humans, such as selecting a series of numbers in a sequence that are scattered across a monitor after showcasing which is which for a fraction of a second (as I believe it was?). It may be worth exploring how other animals react to mixed reality technologies, wallabies ought to be more open due to them being highly adaptable species but we'll see. I wonder whether the concept of uncanny valley exists in a form in case of animals or whether low-fidelity projected environments will be enough.
</p>

<p>
  Apparently Orangutans were very involved with the technology, however they could not interact with them the way they wanted as it limited them to using fingertips. Instead, Kinect was used to create dynamic projection mappings by the use of abstract forms, art created by Orangutans themselves. The aim was the enrichment of their lives, therefore very in line with what they do. Natural user interfaces were the focus, as the collaboration involved multiple parties: Microsoft, University of Melbourne and Victoria Zoo itself. Using the brain is apparently very important part of enrichment. Improving animal welfare and improving Conservational Behavioural Change, perception of not just betterment of humans but betterment of animals as well. Food and social interactions have potential to be explored in terms of the digital technologies.
