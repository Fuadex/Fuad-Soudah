    <i>'Photos are a reflection of your experiences—what drives you, where you’ve been, where you’re going, who you love. SmugMug is a safe (...)'</i><br><br>

    I have been building and refining a system for the previous year. Longer in my mind but eventually it all materialised (bootstrapped?) and formed into what we have right here. I managed to get to somewhat 85% of what I really wanted to achieve and I pretty much did just that. I wanted to see what I am capable of. What my story looks like. Have direct access to it anytime and at any moment. It was difficult, since my story is digitised and scattered across the globe. But it was worth it, as I could put the bricks of myself where I could see myself and then decide towards what direction I am actually heading.<br><br>

    Of course this is not my entire picture. But enough, that can be progressed.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Seamless</h4></center>
    I like to have a flexible system in motion. A reliable combination of modular blocks that can be mixed around and customised as necessary. I was very surprised to see that with the structure I developed for my website, I was still able to incorporate a few interesting features, all without much hassle really as long as I figured out how to utilise a few hacks. For instance, I wanted to have animations that would bring my website to life. And voila, I found a library that blended into my js scripts, that are mandatory for each .html file. These on the other hand, have a rather unified structure, still varrying in specific ways but not too much deviating, as to wreak unnecessary havoc to my time. On the other hand, I have hobbies such as photography. I always thought that by collecting a humongous documentation of the places I visited, I could have a great selection of photos to utilise and feature. While that was true, it soon became a problem, as my hard drives became full in no-time to the point I may get my onedrive account blocked. I have found alternatives that could just befit my ideas of modularity, efficiency, flexibility... I mean, all of it really comes down to having just more freedom, doesn't it?<br><br>

    The number one problem I have with freedom, though, despite it allowing its subjects to do without obstructions, it also can make them somewhat lazy and not susceptible to notions that should be critical to their ways of comprehension. That directly affected myself, although the trigger was the short-term exchange, which had me transition to yet another system. And now, I'm back and struggling with a few things:<br><br>

    - How the * do I do my research this semester.<br>
    - How the * do I eat in this country, I just lost 2.5 kg and gained a bit back.<br>
    - How the * do I manage my time, I had everything within minutes from where I lived, now it's all within hours.<br>
    - How the * do I manage my finances, this became a catastrophy during my exchange but I have expenses now!<br>
    - How the * do I manage my sanity, having all so distant, I need to trigger my liveliness somehow.<br>
    - How the * do I manage myself, as a change of everything, sometimes triggers my inertness.<br><br>

    And so I am slowly getting drained out of my energy, as four walls do not work well towards my performance. It's just so depressing, to live in suburbia from which to reach anything and anybody takes hours. I could say my quality of life is not bad overall. But I know how it can be great and it's ridiculous to think, that it in fact is anywhere but Australia.<br><br>

    I found out today however, that I might have just lost interested in fastfoods. In general foods without much variety but high in calories. Sure, there are still quality snacks, sweets and many things that I just had to have once I came back from overseas but somehow I'm attracted the most to a bit better quality foods and healthier alternatives. While I'll be still inclined to get protein sources, I will also be keen to get veggies along with that. Therefore, salads. Electrolytes sourced from coconut water and perhaps other stuff but still I feel hungrier in this country. And having less energy in general. Could that be the effect of just a significantly colder climate? I somewhat liked what I experienced in Korea.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>
</div>
</div> -->

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
    <center><h4>Phase Three</h4></center>
    
    At some point I decided to start moving. It was getting dangerously late and I still had stuff to see and no clear idea of how I should really leave this hill. I could have made my way back but the route would have taken too long. Could I potentially cut through right to the village? And so what I did, was I went along with a somewhat, something that one could call an offroad, descended a bit and then climbed a bit and ended up in a totally different area. One, that amazed me a bit even more than the other one. It was quite unfortunate, as the positioning of the sun showased the ugliness of a concrete world, which Busan in parts certainly is. With the scorching orange reflecting from Busan's main roads, rooftops and a terrible fog obstructing the wonderful view. I could not quite make of it, was it the smog or just a fog as any? All I knew, was that post-processing these photos will prove difficult. And in the end, an Enfant terrible got born out of it. That having said, I was still astonished, as I had a totally clear view over a totally different part of the city. I would have preferred one over the culture village but that was a very nice Korea to see. And again, some of the, I'd call heritage part of Busan, was within the view too!<br><br>

    I could not stay for too long. In fact, I grew worried of myself as I was on feet for long and my body started letting me know, that it would wish to replenish some fluids. Like with a bottle or two. I mean, with these heats, anything can be possible and despite that I rather know my limits and usually feel like a quite durable fella, I was all alone after all, standing on a cliff with a descending room of hundreds of meters down into the rest of the park. If anything did happen to me, it would be rather be the end. A rather pleasant end, with a view like this. But I felt like exploring more so I took a few final pics, decided to take a further route down, came back, took even more pics and then proceeded to descend towards the unknown but likely the village. That trip was eerie. It went through yet another spot, as it a crossover between a small gym but also as if a hatch, vacated living space. I felt like I should probably keep going. And so I did, for the next 15 minutes, as the trip was rather wild, with a few detours out of which I had to carefully consider which could take me quickly to civilisation. And I popped up at as if a parking lot. Connected to a private area and then a road, which was like an overpass of the village itself. Cool! I Thought. I'll just take a quick stroll along... oh, actually, you know what? Nah, I'll just get into one of these, likely private alleys... which was not. Which took me through a maze of very narrow streets, of small blocks of buildings, equipped with gardens and at times not. With a scooter somewhere but how did they get it up here? With so many stairs and narrow streets, which were clearly just for pedestrians. Every now and then I passed by the village's dwellers. The entire thing was built on a hill and it heavily reminded me of: Italy, in terms of narrow streets and distinct feel - more predominantly Napoli, Portugal in terms of the colorful rooftops, in fact I can't say exactly why Portugal as I'm not entirely sure now in terms of the rooftops but there was something Portugese feeling about all of this - predominantly Porto-ish (as city). And then some of the things I saw on a Polish travellers adventures in the... was it Turkey? This was a truly distinct experience and it took another 10-15 minutes of descending but an experience totally worth doing, especially that it took me to the main street where I got myself with a bottle of Pocari, a bottle of another ionised water, a frozen mango popsickle and... yeah, I'm at Gamcheok Culture Village.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Phase Four</h4></center>
    
    I'll be a bit dissapointing now and won't tell you much about the village, at least not any further in such details. It's hard to put it into words, as it was a bit of a harsh mix of artsy stuff blended into a, potentially traditional landscape. A bit of ascending, a bit of descending. Getting lost among the quite nice buildings with many shops just simply being closed at this particular time. I think it was around 5 or close to 6 even. There was an influx of tourists here, though. Naturally, as the traditional route for tourists would be integrally, in this area, obviously somewhere were buses would stop so that you could truly detour and not bother too much the locals. So after having seen a bit of murals, sculptures, more murals, paintings, graffiti, nice objects. Yes, this was a lively place, positive place, I liked it! Most certainly a highlight. I just wish my feet could support more. Which they naturally could. But it was not about the distance anymore as much it was about the amount of climbing and at this point, it was not just my feet I had to worry about but my legs, which I could consider as the terminator steel grade, considering how much they could put up with but even those, could eventually fail, especially considering I had Seoul tonight and Jeju tomorrow on my agenda. So it was rather straightforward from now on: get on moving, see a bit more on my way to getting the bus and the hell outta here!<br><br>

    My last stop, considering the scarce time I had, was to get to the beach. At first I was like, why should I go to the beach, I'm not like going to take a swim or anything with all my equipment, right? But feeling my feet yearning for some sort of a water source, just probably to chill, as my hiking shoes for some reason might either have problem with ventilation or just capturing heat from the ground, so this time I figured, hell, I'll just chill my feet in the water today. Which I did, eventually, after taking a combination of trips: to the KTX station and a dedicated bus, which totalled in over a 45 minute trip, during which I saw nothing, cause these buses were built to not show much. Still, I managed to get to destination and see a gorgeous beach, with a lively area spanning around it and especially further deep, with clearly lively nightlife, rich with street vendors, lightning shows (!), artists and musicians, showing off their skills and gathering crowds to see them do stuff. On the beach? Bit similar, with lesser crowds, lesser stuff happening but a rich view, literally, of an again, gorgeous beach, fairly chill East Sea water and skyscrapers, off a rather businessy district western side and an overblown, probably even urban skyscrapers, that were in its very words, actual skyscrapers, looking rich and overlooking perhaps not so rich at the moment, as the structures were still under construction. And yet, making a striking impression, with the contrasts it presents, although none really existing, at the very moment that was.<br><br>

    But that very moment, could not last for too long. As I practically really had just an hour, as I had to take under consideration potential traffic congestion. That did not happen and so I concluded my trip, with a very tasty persimon smoothie and a last KTX for the day harbouring me straight to Seoul for around 1.30 am. I just had a bit of time to detour and see the Design Plaza, which was turbo average, if a structure that any student in autocad could design is called neofuturistic, then check me out from Architecture and Design please. Well hey, maybe it really looks astonishing while the lights are on? Cause when they're off, the place seems dead. Even with a few people playing a public piano located on site, still feels dead. And the heritage area mixed into this and the garden area. All felt dead. So to escape from the neofuturistic depth of death, I quickly made my way to 7/11, then to the nightbus taking 1h 30m to arrive at Gimpo airport and ziu, did all the stuff necessary, ziu ziu, Jeju you! Felt like sleeping but the marvel of this world view from the sky kept me awake.<br><br>

    And then? Well and then.<br><br>
