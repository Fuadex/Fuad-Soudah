    <center><h4>Of Peace and Chaos</h4></center>
    I like chaos. I also like to have peace. A nice and tidy environment that is modular and can be rearranged as needed. Flexibility and more ility that was mentioning in my previous Blog. I like to monitor myself and keep track of what I do and whether it has any positive effect on me. I generally like positive tendencies but once I noticed that my weight and even physical appearances start to shift dangerously towards where I would prefer it wouldn't I began to dwell and think and just try to figure out what has changed so radically that I do not feel as effective as I did back in Korea?<br><br>

  <center><h4>I must</h4></center>
    <i>'OH! I must try this I must try that, I must have a beer and a steak with chips to go with! I need some liquorice bullets, 2 litres of double pulp orange juice, an HSP and 24 nuggets!'</i>, my life since I came back was pretty straightforward. I wanted this and that and to kick off like I should have. But something's not quite working. And I didn't know quite why. At first I still had large influxes of energy that I actually spent quite productively on doing a variety of stuff I wanted to do. But then it all died down and my attempts to get it up and running did not quite befit what I had in mind.<br><br>

    The thing is, I know exactly how productive I can become. And I know how lively I can be. I know how far I can reach, with quite a few limits that I discovered that do not seem as such. Rather just a tiny piece of imagination encapsuled. Still, remember when I mentioned all those foods? Well, The lowest I could break was 74.5 kg, which was astonishing to see. Normal was rather 75. Yesterday in the evening it was 78. Today it's like 76.5. It's not bad but... Remember the modularity? See, Onedrive out of a sudden told me that I should do something about it. Otherwise, they will block my access. An access to a cloud filled up by over 1.1 TB of data, some of it, actually most of it historical and crucial data that I plan on sorting out. On one hand I had a few ideas of moving aroudn the data but then I figured, that some of it, is up there but nowhere else really, compared to many of my other stuff I have. So, at this point, it became obvious, that freeing up this space requires me to strengthen the security of my RAW files takes years ago... and so, downloading them, splitting JPGs and RAWs apart, cause I took both at the same time for some ridiculous reasons. And this is a process, as I need to deal between my own backups and cloud backups, so I constantly check the integrity of my downloaded packages... and so I see the photos I took. It seems I didn't change too much in terms of how I took these photos. For better or worse, I might have been a better photographer at time time, I just didn't really know how to do so much to these photos as I do now. I mean, from Adobe's Creative Cloud I just knew Photoshop really... and then, I saw the photos of myself. And I thought, to myself... that I would rather never, ever go back to how I looked at the time.<br><br>

    Then I looked at myself in the mirror. Then I launched a camera on my Surface book 2. Then I took a look at the photos I took not so long ago now, it was what, 2-4 weeks? Then I launch my camera again. Then I took a look at the photos I took... Then I entered my weightscale, which said 77.5, not too bad, I had quite a bit to eat today in fact. And then I took a look again at the photos I took a while ago... The difference, between me weighing 77.5 and when I was nearly 10 kg more, was as if from another world. Something, that just triggers my mind and keeps on galloping along with other issues that I had, most in relation to my family really and the environment I was growing up in... which was convenient. And the convenience got back right at me. I mean, it's not bad when you eat much but you also have to do something with the calories you intake. I didn't do much back in Poland... I didn't do much back in Australia. But I did a fuckload in Korea. And I saw the effects of this upon when I came back to Australia and while I was in Korea.<br><br>

    I remember myself taking a stroll to a hill mid-peak, to take a seat and work on a Blog... I remember doing a second part of this hike and going to get myself a cup of coffee at one of the best, if not the best, coffee places I have ever been to in my life. To have a sip of great coffee. And even get faster internet speeds that I had on both, on campus, or anywhere else in the world to be honest. I remember just taking hikes but also trying to limitly integrate myself with fellow exchange students... Despite how the environment was very studentish, all people were really great people. And somehow it did beat of all the conveniences I have in Australia, which seems to be destroying my integrity, the will to perform quality work and quite maddening in a way or two. This is probably where I'll be spending most of my time this semester. So I might just dedicate myself to a few radical ideas, one of which is trying to make another attempt at weightloss, to keep myself permanently below the 75 threshold. Cause I just liked how I looked and how I felt at the time. But it just might be the tip of the iceberg as there is just more that I need to do.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Perpetual Broken Square</h4></center>
    I need to dedicate myself to just so much. I need to correct my eyesight with a pair of glasses. Turns out, I'm long-sighted and have astigmatism. Maybe that's why I didn't like reading books? But I keep reading tons everyday anyway. About that, I started listening to audiobooks and began to love it, despite the books were quite average-good, what I took under my wings. That is something that I need to begin beefing up on, though. I need to correct my teeth. This is something that my mom continuously feels very bad about. And considering I am in a position when I could take a look into this, I probably just should and get this done, as it's already late enough. I probably should also take a look at other aspects of myself. Including how I look, what clothes I use, what hardware I use. How my life is built, probably. I'd say I can't get everything done in a short period of time... But I also enjoy taking up challenges. They really push you far, to reaches upon achieving which you end up just being satisfied.<br><br>
