    	Oh, sweet continuation!

    <p>
    	Who loves sequels? Ah, the world we're living in! Tv Shows everywhere! At least I see them everywhere. You get hyped, then the hype dies down. Perhaps that's what happens once you realize the amount of hours you've spent your eyes peeled at a small quad-like sheet of... liquid crystal-something display. Even in Harry Potter they wouldn't keep their attention simply glued to their dynamic newspapers. I mean, who cares if you've got dynamic displays all over the world? And you can play whatever you want? (Provided you had a bunch of skills people creating stuff that you're inclined to watch)
    </p>

    <p>
    	I mean, the alternative is to read stuff. But man, you need to work your brain so much. Who needs a brain nowadays anymore?

	  <center><h4>Star Wars: The Fallen Order</h4></center>

  <p>
Man, oh Man. Respawn! Finally they got a big IP to work on, one that they didn't exactly start (like Call of Duty). In the end, this brings lots of expectations from the veterans in this industry. Lots of expectations that got let down in the process, as they have shown some parts of the game that were just... boring. And that's how I found it in the process too! Don't get me wrong, it looks fantastic from the first minutes. These guys are really fantastic when it comes to storytelling, the visuals are also stunning. The animations and character models are top-notch, the world's presentation is stunning. It feels alive from the very beginning and then... it eventually stops. Becoming a rather average action adventure, in which the adventure takes priority. With the problem, that it is really average. Man the controls feel stale. The exploration feels confusing. Battles are at times a nightmare, as the controls are not responsive enough. I blame it on Respawn, who are NOT specialised in this. Sure they can deliver a fantastic FPS but a third person perspective just isn't their cup of tea and it shows.
  </p>

  <p>
  	And here I was complaining on Control being a bit WTF. Here, the problems are, that some things you can interact with, some things you cannot and there is no clear distinction between the two similar objects, be it a wall for example. Often you'll hit invisible walls if you carry off too far. This just cancels out the agency on the player's side, I mean, if you're asking them to do the exploration, why restrict them. Same goes for introducing new skills to your character. You have new skills showcased on your map but you can't activate them until you pass a certain point in the campagin. Why show them at all then? It makes no sense. Sometimes after a cinematic, you'll realise the NPCs have teleported. Although, honestly, the dialogues are the stronger part of the game with fantastic character introduced into the mix. Especially your robot companion, I can see why they did it so well, considering how much of a success (game-wise) Titanfall 2 was. I am growing a bit tired of games that play similarly the same, though. Go here, go there. Do this, do that. Come back. Whatever. This is probably the reason why I don't feel like sticking to this game. It's not bad, it feels very much like Star Wars and a worthy of its title video game. But once you go through the same conventions over and over, you start to feel tired of employed concepts.

  	Man, what a short one this was. Just five episodes of Rick and Morty? Are you mad? Again, like with the Expanse, I'll take what you're offering. And what did the offer? Pretty much the same as usual, a bonanza of cultural references reflected of a broken mirror in Rick and Morty sechuan sauce. You know the drill. Crazily packed, rather dialogue-driven with a fair bit of adventures which reflect a set of specific themes crossovered in more or less subtle way.
</p>

<p>
	Back in style, as usual the usual drill. Heaps of cultural references, overall very enjoyable. Can't complain. Man, I just which the season was a bit longer.

  <center><h4>The Witcher S1</h4></center>

  <p>
Chaotic, bit superficial, at times confusing even for me, who's read the original series. Often feels like a B class film, sometimes it depicts the world's depth, sometimes the CGI is shit. It should get better once the series hits off with the start of the saga, for now you can have a foretaste of Sapkowski's original world, in a highly tokenized form.
</p>

<p>
	...oh, hey. You wanted me to say a few more words, eh? Well, let's just start from the fact that I've read the books years prior. I think I covered all of them, although I can't vouch for the Sword of Destiny. The problem with the story collections on The Witcher, is that they were fun to read while you were 13 years old. But once you grow up, these don't seem to shine as greatly as they used to. It is nice to see that many across industries start to see potential in quality stories (even if not so much to some extent), there used to be I think either a movie or a TV Show carried out by the Polish, which wasn't too good. And there were a series of games, which kind of boosted a Polish company CDP into one of the largest companies on the Polish market, being more capitalised than some banks and alike, usually largest institutions on markets. And that all started from a couple of stories released by a rather unknown author who studied economics in Poland.
</p>

<p>
	The thing about Poland, which relatively recently was discovered to be a fairly good place to visit tourist-wise, is also its population, a portion of which is highly specialised in specific professions. So, we have some great video game developers but also people specialising in animation. And some people actively popularise Polish culture, somehow one thing leading to another and suddenly a Netflix adaptation of The Witcher started brewing up, relaying Polish culture straight into the American mainstream. Oh boy! The hype! And I kind of counted on something really great since I knew some of the people and the studio engaged in the creation. Some others, I didn't know so well like the showrunner or some actresses. Which always is a bit of a gamble, perhaps they'll turn out great, perhaps not so much. It's hard to deduct so early on in the production. So, how did it all turn out?
</p>

<p>
	Well, first of all, the show was built upon the stories, not the saga. And the stories, as I've mentioned, are rather average. Shorter, which makes for the medium itself just harder to build anything that has legs and arms, all in all. Although, technically, you could do some stuff around it, even if the stories, from what I recall, were rather character-centric, rather than the fantastic and multilayered world-building that the saga is known for, which extends and relates with the characters involved, as in, they're much stronger and refined in the saga as well. In the end, I'll start from praise: Henry Cavill did well, very well indeed. The guy is a true professional, fantastically prepared, looks like Geralt, behaves like Geralt. I loved his choreography as well, although to be fair, I only was blown away by the sequence created in Blaviken. Which I read, that was prepared by a guy Cavill brought onboard. I guess, after all, if you have people passionate about the world and the project and really hard working, you can get some amazing results, as Cavill certainly felt to fit in the role well and to be well onboard with what the Witcher, in total, in terms of the books and games and the entire Universe, what it is about and what it conveys. Dandelion was casted fantastically. The rest of the actors has its rather lows I'd say. First of all, it's highly tokenised, which alters with the setting of the Universe. In the end I actually fairly got used to it but once you read the books and have the characters built in your head and then see how they were casted in the TV Show, things start getting fucked in your head. Triss isn't red headed? Yennefer doesn't have curls? Driads from Brokilon are as if from Brooklyn? (I know that's more of a stereotype but you can't help but bring this out when you watch this and compare to what you read and then knowing stereotypes). In the end, as I've mentioned, you get used to it, as the actresses don't really do a bad job but they don't quite excel at conveying the motivations driving the characters. And once you add to this the highly mixed ethnicity, I know it's a fantasy show but the setting of the show is one of the things it makes it unique. There are not that many western shows that depict Eastern Europe with its perspective and set of problems through the lens of Eastern European authors. And since there are so many elements that could be related across the continents, flatting it out like this just to appeal to certain groups in the American audience (primarily) feels short-sighted.
</p>

<p>
	The show unfortunately takes numerous hits from how it's presented and carried out as well. Often it feels like a type B film, CGI sometimes is great and sometimes it lacks a fair bit and that extends onto almost every single element in this show. Acting, presentation, stylisation, make-up, choreography. It's a bit sad, as it was supposed to be the new Game of Thrones and I still feel it has the potential to become one. The creators certainly think so and after seeing the aftermath, it would seem there is a massive fanbase of the show right now, who certainly had big hopes for this. The question is, whether they'll stay with it after the first season. Which wasn't necessarily bad but it certainly lacks in many lengths the quality good tv shows have to offer its audience. This should improve with subsequent seasons which will take upon the saga. And certainly the confusion stemming from the mashed timeline will, should stop being the case (man it even confused me after all). Let's give it another chance with season 2, shall we? This series deserves it.

<center><h4>The Expanse S4</h4></center>

    <p>
Mmm, yes. The Expanse. Every now and then you get a show released by a, should I call them, television networks? These still are television networks, right? HBO is one, NBC is one. There are some others like ABC and some others. It's like, as if, they don't exist to the external world, unless you're an American and even then, I'm not sure whether they still actually exist to the American people. I mean, they are the ones who eventually started to switch to Netflix and peeps there were like, hold on, why not take over the world now? Which they did, seeing how many folks were using VPNs to watch Netflix and thinkin', well, that ain't right. We've got more folks watching then there are citiz... oh, nevermind. You introduce a good product and it's likely people will start using it, right?
  </p>

  <p>
  	So, we had Hannibal from NBC. Lost from ABC. And The Expanse from SyFy. I'm not entirely sure if they're a network to be honest. I know for a fact, that they were known for releasing quite average shows, though. No biggie. This time, it seems they decided to do something better, as it turned out. Taking something well regarded, such as a series of books and turning them into an adaptation that didn't seem to really feel inferior to anything else out there. With the first season being slightly short and claustrophobic but directed quite masterfully and rather beautifully, elevating some prolonged scenes to new highs. I mean, without massive budgets, you always need to cut some corners, so why not have a cookie and eat a cookie? Then having a second, larger season and third, very uneven season as if split into a mediocre half and quite decent second half, all the way to becoming, as a great show, becoming cancelled. And becoming revived, as apparently Jeff Bezos is a fan of the books and figured, why not continue? (perhaps they also took a look at some reviews and figured a great show is about to shoo away right from their noses). I mean, as a show, it had most of it all: great direction, relatively widely unknown cast who performed rather stellarly in their own ways, a believeable and well showcased universe in its breadth, depth and detail, which, I would only assume, very well portrayed the original. I personally very warmly welcomed the phenomenally presented intricacies and scalability of the storytelling, relaying from larger scale matters to rather smaller issues that would resonate back and forth. And I think this is the strongest part of this show, of how it depicts the world, not just the scale of it but all the parts, in its beauty and brutality.
  </p>

  <p>
  	So, once Amazon picked it up, what could I expect? Well, I didn't expect anything bad, seeing how they just fund stuff and creative people come up with stuff the way they envision it. Season 4 is definitely a bit more concentrated, primarily on one area and it is also slightly shorter than expected but I think it worked in favour of the show. Didn't take anything aback, retained all the positive elements, perhaps made it a bit more complex but carried on with the developments in a fantastic fashion. As in, not like, fantasy-like, just, really superB. I think it further introduced a little more of subtleties into the show, which is always nice to see in sci-fi if carried out right. I'm looking forward to seeing more but hey, I'll take what they're offering as of now.
  </p>

  <p>
  	And to top it off with a short, concentrated accent: Amazingly intertwines meticulous attention to detail and subtleties in a drive to tell, this time, a more focused yet a refined story reflecting on the macrocosm of a complex, multilayered universe. This is my personal the end of the year favourite.

  <center><h4>Genius Party</h4></center>

  <p>
I tried getting myself into a couple of anthologies. I feel this is a fantastic format in which a variety of creative teams have the unusual opportunity to create something the way they want, to excel at something in what they do best. Because, in the end, how do you end up controlling the creative process of multiple studios in parallel? Think, Love, Death and Robots, likely one of my favourite shows of all time (as of now), which demonstrates what happens when you pour money into fantastic people and tell them to create fantastic things with industry veterans at its helm. I found animatrix to also be a bit of my cup of tea and I mean, if you think about it, any movie festival is a bit of an anthological thing, although not really. It's like, you're buying a cat in a bag but you're fairly sure it's going to be amazing, if it's an animation anthology. And hey! It you'd expect it to become such, especially, if you realise an amazing director is involve in it. I tried to try a couple of other stuff that Sinichiro Watanabe was involved in, Genius Party was one of it. It's kind of a classic, so I tried it.
  </p>

  <p>
  	And I was a bit surprised to see that it wasn't just as amazing as I expected it. Sure it had some moments, highs and lows. It would seem it was partially children-driven, as if the show was centred towards the creativity elicited by children. But there was also some extremely abstract piece that I did not enjoy, at all. I guess Sinichiro's piece was the one I enjoyed the most, you could tell by how the action was driven at times and some sequences. But hey, it's not like it's all bad. Overall, there is some good animation to be experienced here. Just, don't get your expectations elevated too far out.

  <center><h4>Kick-Ass 2</h4></center>

  <p>
Man, I don't even know if I should cover this one. Every now and then you end up watching a movie that, I mean, there's nothing bad about watching it. Except that it doesn't necessarily need a review. Here we have Kick-Ass, sequel of it. I mean the original was kinda fun to watch, concentrating on someone who decided to become a superhero, cause why not. The sequel kinda, well, continues this. And it extends in some ways but overall feels a bit trite and lacking, well, much in everything. But, you know, it's enjoyable so I'll just leave it at that.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
