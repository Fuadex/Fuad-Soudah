    	Hmm.. Let's see, while I'm still in the old continent, I figured I'm gonna take a look at some real old stuff. Honestly, for me, my wellbeing, it's usually best if I don't spend too much time not doing much. As suddenly it turns out, that where I used to live, it wasn't truly exceptional. It puts you into perspective, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the drum-kit from Guitar Hero, prompted me, that I had a PS3 that I didn't really use as much. And then, an old decoder downstairs reminded me, that there used to be a channel I'd watch called Game One, which pretty much got me into the whole remix gig, at least accelerated it after having seen some others on youtube. And also Corridor Digital, which I discovered via Freddiew channel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both Corridor and GameOne turned out to be really amazing. And so I'm watching playlists on youtube, a bit too much frankly. But I'm also rediscovering and learning so much...

  <center><h4>Carole & Tuesday</h4></center>

  <p>
Well, Sinichiro Watanabe. That's what I originally thought. Then it turned out there is not much of Sinichiro's handiwork here which saddened me. In fact, this is one of those shows that is more directed towards the teenage audience if not the even younger part. Although, it's not at least due to one or a few scenes featured. Netflix is really playing with fire here, if they're really co-producing it. But I mean, Carole & Tuesday is a nice concept overall. It's got a conceptual frame that stems from criticising the music and the entertainment industry and it does it explicably well. The depth is there and that's what I'm happy about, except the driver of the story is kept in a rather romantic and frankly bit infantile way. It's okay, as the target audience is certainly one that is just simply younger. But seeing Sinichiro as an executive of this show, I had more hopes.
</p>

<p>
The music featured is actually really good and the spread of styles and their execution is impressive. You wouldn't except any less probably from a show that treats this particular subject but, you know, I wouldn't really jump into conclusions at any stage. There is a lot of original songs that are actually performed in a beautiful way, so it's easier to connect with the characters. The way they unravel and connect with other characters in the show in fact lowers the immersion in my perspective and the parts when they perform kinda balance the lows out. Many of the fillers which would seem so as, are actually insightful and provide an additional important dimension to the problematique in focus of the show. Of course, there are the mains and supporting characters but it is clear in my view that there are larger subjects encapsulated in this show and they are being depicted quite thoroughly. I want to stress this, as even though the show is lead through the lens of the characters often, there is just more to it and some parts of the audience might just get tired of the show due to the infantility of, well, the drive of the show. I also like the bulk of references to metropolises like New York, the show feels a lot like New York and goes hand-in-hand with what's depicted too so.
</p>

<p>
All in all, Carole & Tuesday is a show that is rather directed towards younger audiences, especially those who have aspirations for resolving and evolving their artistic skills. Even some students would appreciate it. There is a certain amount of depth that make it not just enjoyable but also informing watch, it is multidimensional and quite imaginative in many lengths. It is however driven in a bit too simpleminded way, which can deter some from it. There are some shows that capture similar subjects in a notch better fashion but now that I think about it, there not that many and of those that do exist, have this teenagey feel about it. Like Black Mirror's episode with Miley Cyrus, I'm sure there was something else there too. Perfect Blue breaks through these chains but is there anything that exceptional that loses its innocence of form? I don't recall at the time but it's really not a bad show to follow, even if just to kill time with.

    <center><h4>Mindhunter Season 2</h4></center>

    <p>
Well, this a show that is good.
</p>

<p>
Eh, I should say something more this, right? Well, it wasn't as good as the predecessor, original season 1. I actually engaged in a dialogue with a friend of mine who really bashed this one. Apparently it lost a lot of its subliminal meaning and terminology that could be further explored. I never really cared as much, I just appreciated the phenomenal acting and thick, dense atmosphere that you could bite through and chew with your teeth easily. And that kinda remained with the second season. At a lesser scale but it prevailed. Again this is yet another show which seems to detour to fillers, I explain a few other shows later on that went onto the sexuality and blablabla, concentrating on the characters while it doesn't really contribute to the overall show. There is a quite interesting family-related plotline but other than this, I liked the move onto the Atlanta case. Which unravels but which also is lead in a way that keeps you unsettled all the way 'till the end of the show.
</p>

<p>
One thing that I should point out is the Fincher work on it that shows up, like at one point in which I believe one of the criminals talks about the crime he committed. And there is nothing that exceptional perhaps about the situation per say, except, that the audio work here was something out of this world. As it contributed flawlessly to the story being told, going hand-in-hand and unravelling in so subtle but unnerving and unsettling way in a way that I have really, at most very rarely experienced in cinematography as a whole. I mean, Fincher's show, what else could you expect? Well, other than this, the worldbuilding is great, acting keeps its highs. It'd be phenomenal, except that it kinda kicks back and loses focus, looking in a few places and suddenly the audience doesn't see the thing really building towards anything. Which makes sense once I think about it, in real life that's probably how it at least could have easily been. But I guess, having some form of a like Breaking Baddy conclusion is very much demanded, at least by me and I like to see how a structure is built throughout. There's not much of this structure being built here. It's just in place, without getting expanded. It's just a bit of cosmetics here and there and I guess that's all. Solid all in all. But that's all.

  <center><h4>Weathering With You</h4></center>

  <p>
I am actually surprised that I am giving this movie such a high note as in certain moments it deserved less. Where do I start? I should really stop paying attention to ads cause they really make a jar of jelly out of my brains. I bit the part where it said 'created by people who made Your Name' but some alarms should've rang when they also advertised that it is much better than the referenced movie. I mean, how much better can it get? Disregarding the fact it loses a lot of its magic on the second run, it would be actually hard to beat this one. And it didn't. In fact, I was a bit seduced by the description of the movie, a short on what's it about. The movie however didn't really elaborate on some of this and placed the focus a bit elsewhere, which on its own is not bad, except there was lots of potential to be explored.
</p>

<p>
What I found so bad about this movie was its infantility. Its focus was entirely on characters who were not really that interesting to begin with in any way. There were some parts embedded into the movie that felt detached from the whole. There was a lot of stuff that just was without much that would contribute the audience. It was a lot of wobbly wobble and not much to support either. There were no clear motifs attached, nothing really standing out except for the main character who could control the weather. But still nothing much stemmed out of even this and so the movie turned out just simply as bland, nothing more than a cheeseburger you'd get at mcdonalds, despite it being advertised as an experience one-of-a-kind that comes once-in-a-lifetime. And all those 'funny' dialogue lines that came through it, I can understand the audience in the cinema willing to have some fun from watching the movie but laughing at trivialisms and cliched jokes just feels low.
</p>

<p>
What did actually lift the experience up, was the art. There were some, near classic scenes that were just staggeringly beautiful. A feast for your eyes and even though the colouring of the movie kinda lacked behind, there were some scenes that were just purely beautiful. So beautiful, that suddenly I became generous and gave this a 6, instead of something that it would have much more deserved for.

  <center><h4>Money Heist Season 3</h4></center>

  <p>
I have so many questions. This show never was really genius all in all. I saw this as the contemporary Prison Break, which was real popular at the time. At the time like, well over a decade and a half ago. The concept is physically similar if you look at it, a number of characters enclosed in a space, trying to get out but after achieving something. Some backstories being lead individually with each episode... I mean at that stage you could even argue Orange is The New Black is like Prison Break. I mean, if you'd like to follow any show to, you could actually follow Prison Break, at least for its first 2 seasons when it was solid. But the amount of action depicted here, yeah, Money Heist is Prison Brakey.
</p>

<p>
Now the question, how good is it an a standalone, though. Well, like I said, I have so many questions. And I had them in fact in previous seasons two, except they didn't ramp up as much as they did in season 3. I mean, the second one had some quite epic moments that raised a number of questions as to what the hell was happening and how in fact was all this really happening but I'd let many of those moments slide, as they kind of could slip through. But with the third season, it's just way to magicky. I mean, the pressure the producers must have placed on the writers of this one! How to creatively get out of the mud to keep this still coherent, I mean I'd probably drop dead on the spot. I just hope they get paid enough in the end. The problem that I saw was, that there were many changes by the end of the second season, some of which were very radical so to say. But somehow they manage to stir it all somewhat well and lay it out with a set of new characters, who are not in fact, even at all disappointing. It's nice to see that we are back with La Casa del Papel, although I'm a bit concerned with the increasing placement of filler sexuality-centred dialogue lines. They just tend to bring out the direction out in weird dynamics, romanticising (in the centuries ago way) the screenplay, that just feels a bit out of touch with the, still, well, somewhat magical reality that is happening in the show nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
Overall following the show is not too daunting, in fact the action sequences are quite fulfilling, although some parts feel too much action-filmey, lacking sense overall. It's a good and non-engaging watch but it does start to move outside of the safe boundaries in terms of how it is written. At times, stuff just feels to kinda clash with the nature of who's who and the actions that are being undertaken. It's not radically bad to the point you'd get bolted out of immersion. But enough to degrade the experience to being lesser than what it could be.

  <center><h4>Stranger Things Season 3</h4></center>

  <p>
I enjoyed the show as being a festival of Spielberg embedded into a TV wrap. Which was rather successful too, very stellarly acted out, directed, having this really nice, rather Americaney feel to it. And you know, there is the childhood feel too. And the Spielberg all over with the thousands of references attached to it. But somehow some things changed with the new season. As if, it is the same experience but suddenly, there are some things that make it, ugh, stranger. Remember my point about me suddenly seeing a surprisingly increased amount of sexual-centred conversations in La Casa Del Papel? Well, guess what's happening in this show too. Suddenly we are being exposed to a wiiiide range of plot lines of which entire nature lays either in romantic relations or the nature of the leading casts sexuality. I don't mind having it in show all in all. I just don't see how having those in swath amounts is going to contribute towards building a stronger show, especially that I don't recall anything Spielbergey (which it doesn't need to be) about it. It's just a lot of unnecessary filler, of which as I pointed already out, there is a massive and almost unsettling amount.
</p>

<p>
About the unsettling things now. I always saw Stranger Things as a show for families really to enjoy together. But with this new season, I must say I would not let my children watch is. Let alone strong sexual references and horrorlike elements, there is just simply a lot of gore showcased in this one. I mean, think - people melting down. I've seen this before actually done in very horrible ways but pushing the plot forward in very touching ways. But here it's like, having gore just for the sake of having gore. And the CGI of it isn't really that impressive either. Again, this doesn't exactly contribute to the story and make it less digestible for the regular viewer. Also in case of writing, having an intrigue with Russians feels far-fetched. There is a set of fantastic elements attached to this show, that just makes it less believable and that's overall sad to see. One thing is having paranormal abilities demonstrated by leading characters but another to have stuff that just is rather, eh, doesn't match the world depicted in it. That extends onto some of the screenplay too.
</p>

<p>
Disregarding the downsides, the show remains with a Spielbergey vibe and it's actually nice to follow. Although it's a bit split into different sections which loses on its coherence, it's just almost always harder and less immersive to follow a set of characters being lead in different groups. But it's nice overall. Just the fillers and clashy parts make it a notch worse of an experience than it should.

  <center><h4>Disenchantment Part 2</h4></center>

  <p>
My friends with whom I've been in conversation with in regards to Disenchantment had only one thing to say to me: Futurama is better. Way better. And I'm like - I've never seen Futurama. And I've never seen The Simpsons (well, a few episodes maybe I did), Family Guy and all the cohort that normal people watch. I did see some episodes of the Polish equivalents like Włatcy Móch or Kapitan Bomba but I'd say I kinda took a pass on all the comedy animation series. Altogether with, let's say, How I Met Your Mother series and all the cohort, rather focusing on dramas all in all, where nobody laughs in the background etc. I would like to think it didn't turn me too much into a grumpy fellow (perhaps it did?) but there's a lot of cool features revolving about these series and I do love Animation, a love that I've been reliving from my childhood years when I was watching cartoons like - Samurai Jack, Johnny Bravo etc. Except, with times changing, Samurai Jack apparently came back but specifically as an adult-oriented cartoon shown on Adult Swim. I guess times are really changing then? Even Anime is now probably more seen as a normative genre?
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoyed the first season of Disenchantment. It was lightweight, kind of funny here and there. Had a nice course of dynamics and storyline progression, that as if did not progress but with time it did and retained coherence. There was a lot of cool multitude of episodes where as I'd call, the tail was wagging the dog, back and forth. Just the way the show's creators decided to play with the meaning of words and contexts is generally enjoyable. But with this season, it kinda really lost even the mild enjoyability the first season had. I kind of feel as if the creators were not really even that much into actually creating this, there is a nice background and some nice episodes that portray even more interesting themes and universes but the show doesn't pull the tongue out of what the show produces and showcases, which ultimately just severes what more interesting plotlines there may be. Which, to be fair, is kind of a standard for this type of shows but the thing is, many of the singular more standalone episodes lack the progression, the wit and conclusion. Which eventually puts at harms way the overall quality of the show.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't get me wrong, it's still an enjoyable thing to watch but you'll be left by the end of it with the feeling that more could've been concentrated into this, so that we, the audience, could end up with a general feel of fulfillment. But ultimately it didn't get even halfway there.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
