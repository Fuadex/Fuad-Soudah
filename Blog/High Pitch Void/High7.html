    <center><h4>Ohhh...</h4></center>
    <p>Such a wonderful feeling, my semester's done, I managed to tie a number of loose ends and create more. I have time for myself and with the help of some mate, I can get right to business! This time, I'll go in reverse schedule and showcase what I've seen recently. All the way to my last reported material.</p>

    <p>Do you have the same feeling when you open up Netflix or even bloody Steam and realise, there is nothing for you to play? I guess having too many options eventually leaves you empty handed and I usually set my aims on particular subjects, so here: a few movies, a few animes, series... Some of those were not so easy to track down in fact.</p>
    
    <p>But let's get started!</p>
  </div><br>

  <center><h4>Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion</h4></center>

  <p>R1 (Season 1)</p>

  <p>One of the shows that I did not intend on seeing, especially through. It's so bad that it's ridiculous, the scenario is all over the place, beaten up, with so many holes that if it was a ship, aircraft or literally anything, it would go down in minutes. But somehow there is something about its dynamism and general fun that comes out of it with the addition of quite interesting historical and cultural nuances, making it a teeny bit more enjoyable, even if cringy and adolescent for a quite substantial time. I can't help but notice this is a show created to accommodate literally everyone, high school audience, adults, perhaps even younger ones as well, although considering the thick themes embedded, I am still struggling on figuring out exactly for whom is this series after all. With princesses, high schoolers, magic, racism, totalitarian empires, mechs, war, ethnical cleansing and many more. This is so thick with elements that it's difficult to establish a clear answer for what this actually is. In the end, the plot takes a hit due to its looseness but it remains enjoyable. How come?</p>

  <p>I guess I have a soft spot for productions which showcase an array of details, I hate when it ultimately crumbles but this one does not deteriorate to any extent. It is a peculiar case of entailing the middle ground with solid hints of all the best and worst that, well, anime so far can deliver. There is a decent balance between drama and action. I made a connotation to Neon Genesis Evangelion due to the presence of mechs but unlike in Evangelion, Code Guess has much less wearisome disruptors in terms of how drama features interfere with action. Even though there is an overwhelming lack of coherence in terms of what the characters know and don't, what Code Guess doesn't have what I also tend to hate, is sudden changes that occurr in characters' psychological profile. These are often subtle here and despite all the unnatural happening, some form of natural feel remains due to the lack of all the real bad.</p>

  <p>Still, despite all that I cannot recommend this show with clear conscience. It is sort of perfect if you need something to kill time with while you commute, as it is fun to watch. But is there anything really valuable coming out of this show? Nothing that I have not seen before, it also mixes a lot of interesting concepts which makes it an interesting standalone and even an engaging one but once I rethink of what I've actually seen, it all turns a little dry.</p>

    <p><center>7/10</center></p><br>

    <p>R2 (Season 2)</p>

    <p>The second season managed to improve in many ways, first of all by making sure the plot is tightly defined and consistent with itself. An especially important feature missing from its original and despite rolling in, in a very unnatural setting, all somewhat became quite logically explained, kudos to the creators. The flow is quite nicely constructed and unravels into geopolitical spheres and entwines the reality foreset in the original. I am starting to appreciate the complexity of the world even more now and the number of themes embedded, also the show feels a bit less adolescent which is another good thing. But as they did that, somehow some of the more interesting and rough sequences happening in R1 became slightly, well, not present and a slight push towards sexualising characters was established. Which is fine, that all are still kept within confinements. The dynamism remains here and the consistency of characters. It watches really well overall and progresses nicely.</p>

    <p>In the end, the show maintains its course and coherency, despite detaching a notch at specific points to the verge of becoming way too far-fetched. But the complexity is brought out in this season and showcased at full scale by the subtle introduction of new characters, maintanance of current archetypes and the induction of paramount and strong themes. The dynamism picks up with a few twists, not as major as in season one but with enough fuel to shape the structure of the next episodes. The show also feels complete towards its concluding episodes. The amount of cultural nuances thickens and leaves the viewer with a particular awe, in my case, my first approach towards the show ended up with a straight-out rejection due to its overal chaos revolving around its screenplay. Season 2 improves heaps, although I still can't give any more than 8. It really upped its game but its overall cringiness, ecchiness and moralisatory course just shakes off on me. It still got really good nevertheless, to the point that now I could potentially even recommend the show.</p>

    <center><h4>Ślepnąc od Świateł</h4></center>

    <p>Ohh... This was so difficult to find that it took almost a miracle for me to hunt it down. For some reason, HBO has better VPN-protection technologies than its competitors, which obviously turned against me, as I was not able to see any of it with my commercial NordVPN. Still, I managed to get my hands on this and see what's with the general appraisal of the polish community for a new production made by a guy I only know from... making a really good music video for a polish reggae band? If that's not already triggering alarms, then let me just add, that this was exactly which got me a bit excited for this show. In fact, I haven't really seen many overwhelmingly good polish tv shows for... well, as far as I can remember?</p>

    <p>And so the with the first minutes the series decided to impress me with stale acting and disattached scene combination. I figured, that's fine, this will soon kick off but as the show progressed, I realised a few things: first, that the color-grading feels below set expectations. That started to trigger some alarms, as the promotionals shots I've come across were stellar and what I was presented with, was somewhat, well, just as bland as the acting was. Turned out, my colour profiles got hijacked by one of the recent windows insider updates. Eventually I double checked and it was good, the arrangement of lightning all in all is quite impressive in this show. Not just that but the approach to inject continuous longshots. Note, this is a drama, I don't come across that often such directorship but it is extremely difficult to pull it all off well and unfortunately, in this show one can see how a combination of really good concepts get lost a bit in the crowd of. Well. As said, really good concepts but with mixed execution.</p>

    <p>Let's see. The main character doesn't strike as particularly interesting. His play is fine, there were many issues raised as if he was just bland. Sure he was but the role he was given seemed to be just as such, hence I cannot say much against him, except at times there is a specific feel of plasticity that comes and goes, nothing to be helped really. Then there are other actors who again range from very close, to if just plain incredible performance (Frycz!) to others who just do below expectations, mainly consisting of minor/supporting roles. Characterisation was kept to high standards, special effects were average. The storyline was surprisingly consistent, even if at times (although rarely) quite naiive. There were numerous supernatural sequences, stepping outside the formal drama-style of the show itself. The fine artsy parts felt overall mediocre, I just couldn't identify any values attached or anything that could contribute to the show itself, in fact it disrupted unnecessarily the flow. Some others were plain interesting, still disruptive but blended well with the crawling insanity that progressed with the show, finally something particularly interesting blended in! Which points towards another really good thing: the storyline is fairly, although not overly complex by the addition of a variety of characters who come through, vanish and happen again, all in consistent manner. It's nice to see a show, which does this well, there are no clearly defined protagonists and antagonists, the concept shifts smoothly throughout the show and concludes in a satisfactory manner.<br>
    (this is not a spoiler, I just stated I liked how the show came to its conclusion).</p>

    <p>I have mentioned previously of the disruptive scenes, as there were more and frankly, most of them felt obsolete. I understand the intentions and as I understand, the director/producer of this show has a tendency to introduce experimental features and perform a bit more ambitiously. All of this, I always welcome with my arms open wide. However, I can't help but notice the issues ruffling up the show, which are just plain production-related mistakes: badly handled camerawork, acting feeling mocky, stiff dialogues, at times unsynchronized soundtrack and tendencious sound effects. But despite it all, there is a lot of things happening in the show and overall, despite being fairly exaggerated in all directions in terms of how the reality is portrayed in the show it all feels... beliveable. I feel that's an accomplishment, the ability to keep the natural feel of it all, especially that I couldn't say any scene felt detached from the showcased reality at any inch. It's a very interesting watch and considering the number of elements imbued, it might bring more joy with subsequent binging.</p>

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
