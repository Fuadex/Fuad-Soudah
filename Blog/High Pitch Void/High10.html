  <center><h4>One Punch Man Season 2</h4></center>

  <p>
    The show pretty much opens up the way One Punch Man would. I had my hopes up a while ago as it seemed the studio working on the show had changed and from what I managed to peek across at, it didn't seem to really help the series. But now that I did see a bit, I'm like. Yeah, it's good. But it kinda hit a slide by 2-3 stars, I think any show would wish to be in the comfort of this, though as sliding from 10 to 8 or 7 is still not such a big hit, despite of how it would seem to any passing peek-a-boo guy. The problem as much as it is the strength of this season is, are the characters, who are great to follow with all the spongy dialogues and cheesy bits that make it pleasant to follow. But as it focuses on the characters, somehow all the magic began to everescence, perhaps it's about the characters again that the steam cooled off and there is not as much sexyness about all the depicted. Perhaps it's just the lack of clear lead of where it is all going. Perhaps the very slow animation style and generally keeping the pace down. Yes, it's definitely about the pace, it feels that it is really not moving at all actually. Sadly.
  </p>

  <p>
    But despite all that it's still an enjoyable show, it's got the wit, the power and it's generally one punch man, just not the package I expected but hey, not everyone can maintain greatness, in fact it's one of the most difficult things to do really. It follows at an incredibly slow pace, though. And finishes blandly. I guess it's okay if a show marks a dip but you'd just expect more from shows that really did very well and all of a sudden just collapse somewhat. I still really like the characters, though. It's a bit addictive, I'll admit, which ain't too healthy. But because of the characters and often the scenario, watching it all marks a plaeasnt experience (too some degree, considering the season).

  <center><h4>Chernobyl</h4></center>

  <p>
    What a miniseries! But I also have a problem, as many have called it as the best show ever produced. While I can see why some have named it as such, I must go out in the middle and voice by humble opinion, that it's quite a bit of an overstatement that I just can't exactly agree with.
  </p>

  <p>
    First of all, I started feeling hyped for the show sometime the show started being advertised, probably early when Game of Thrones was being screened with the exact same trailer popping up at beginning of each Game of Thrones episode. The trailer, was, well mildly put, very good and certainly the hype was peaking on my end. With the show being created as something as if, horrorlike, very much dire and apocalypse-looking in a very compelling way. But as I am experienced with extremely well-put trailers but the shows they advertised for being, mildly put, quite shiite, I awaited with my hopes locked firmly low. At about 3.6 roentgen, not great, not terrible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then it came and I was like, yeah, it's pretty good actually. Although I expected something much heavier like the trailers advertised. So I guess I wanted more. Especially, that it was just simply 5 episodes, I wanted more and I felt there was more to be said in the story. The problem I had was already with how it started. How the story was at first so much contained. And then how it all felt so british, like a british Chernobyl which has some good to it, I mean what if it happened in the west? Let's portray how it could have been in the west as well. As genius as it sounds, the show starts to lack a bit with the atmosphere just because of this, obvious actually, decision. Especially that all of it seemed to have been filmed somewhere around the site, which again turned out phenomenal. I don't think the western audience actually has been exposed much to Eastern Europe all-in-all and whenever it was, it was actually quite skewed in ways. Even colorised in ways that made it fake, for instance by portraying Polish people with Russian-speaking actors who did not do well with conveying the Polish. Just an example. Here I could not spot too much falsification happening, all-in-all the details seemed to be at the heart of the show but it did not quite went towards demonising perhaps atom energy as such. It didn't seem to portray perhaps the apocalypse as an apocalypse. It seemed to take a critical stance towards some areas and showcase the progression of what happened drama-style through the lens of what system it happened in.
  </p>

  <p>
    And again, here there are a few more problems that I had with the show as it overly-dramatized some parts. The dialogue-lines alone felt so American-like, so solemn. The actors have done a fantastic job, though, especially the protagonists. At times it seemed too, again, contained in some parts and some secondary plotlines seemed to diverge a bit from the main story but they also made a good job, in turn, to showcase the extent of the tragedy. I very much liked how the creators reached a bit deeper also into the history of Ukraine and how the cultural parts impacted the entire story. Some points of the show were especially firm here. Perhaps one of the reasons why the audience enjoyed it as much. Still, I felt more could've been introduced and the atmosphere could have benefited from more naturalistic way of leading the show. Perhaps it could have lost a lot of the praise it gained but in the end, I would have welcomed a The Wire version of Chernobyl, instead of, damn, I don't know, any good major movie screened form of Chernobyl, which it in fact just is?

  <center><h4>Black Mirror Season 5</h4></center>

  <p>
   Ahh, my favourite show, even after it dipped, still remained ringing in my memories and so I had to see the new.

S05E01 - Striking Vipers - 10/10

It just feels complete. Top of the line performance. Phenomenal script. But the cherry on top is its main story arc. Reminds me of analogical in Blade Runner 2049, it's just not easy to conjure a love story and make it fresh, keeping it Black Mirrorish, you know? On the outside it feels very mundane but that's also its silver lining - it just feels so real. And the details back it nicely.

S05E02 - Smithereens - 7/10

I get the context but it unravels too slow. It's kinda White Bear type of an episode but the fireworks at the end end up dudded up. Perhaps my hopes were set too high but it does lack detail, Charlie Brooker comes up with such episodes at times, doesn't mean they're bad, it's just... don't stretch out so much and make the twist fuller-bodied, cause otherwise it's just good stuff but with nothing to catalyse it.

S05E03 - Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too - 8/10

This is good, very well performed by all parties. Unfortunately, clichés are all over, directed towards the wider audience, which kinda makes it dry half-way through, even the solid character development fails to make up for all that. But the dialogues consistently keep a microdose of depth, giving a glimpse at an unveiled reality, that in ways is already out there. It's kinda like a good disney/pixar/dreamworks movie. It's fun to watch for kids and adults alike, as each will find their own.

..

In conclusion, this is a rather fairly light yet powerful black mirror season. At its peak imho since Netflix picked it up. It may feel bland at times but there is just simply often too much detail that I don't really see in contemporary media and, honestly, all of these episodes is just triple A craftsmanship at its best. Well casted, written, directed, designed, just full-on Black Mirror depicting and playing out a reality, that is really already here.

..also, I wonder how Trent Reznor reacted to E03 👽

  <center><h4>Hardcore Henry</h4></center>

  <p>
    I played First Person Shooters for quite a chunk of my younger part of life. Also the more general form of First Person Perspective, whether venturing through medieval lands or futuristic dystopias, these usually tend to be slightly more immersive whenever you put the player at the forefront, as if looking through the protagonist's eyes and making the decisions. Although, I'd polemize with myself in this regards, as I often do. Still, in case of movies the concept never really materialized from what I've seen by far. I did see two music videos in which the entirety was shot, as if, from First Person Persective, Biting Elbows the band is called. And these two videos were real entertaining. So... what about a movie done in such convention?
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, again, it's fun. It's really fun but what makes it even better is that it's quite well constructed. It's almost a typical action-based movie, although, as you might have guessed it, all made FPP. But even putting it all in FPP does not free it up from responsibility to keep its integrity in all its forms. And so, the movie is plot-driven and the plot itself is, ok I guess. A combination of a love story entwined with an intrigue, nothing avant-guard here to be found. And so the entire concept concentrates on the action which is truly action-packed, with amazing stunts, fighting scenes and actually all of it. There's a bit of wit and imagination poured into the production and the plot unravels in a rather well-defined manner. There is not much for me to criticize. A few letdowns here and there, perhaps in terms of acting or some details but otherwise - It's tasty, enjoyable and delivers what it was probably originally made for: Enjoyment of crude, rather plain but still a solid action-packed movie. Oh, also it's a bit endemic as there is a bit of Russia depicted in the movie, a change of scenery is usually good for anybody.

  <center><h4>Avengers: Endgame</h4></center>

  <p>
    Ahhh, Avengers. There was so much hype encompassing this one, leaving the audience after the previous release jawless and in shock. I mean, even I was quite surprised to see how Infinity War turned out, as a few elements were made with premeditation to be different compared to the Avengers series. Despite being rather cosmetic, I mean, in nature they kind of were, creating an antagonist for whom the audience could start developing empathy for and having an ending that, pretty much did not come with a satisfying conclusion could have been shocking for lots who stormed the theaters last year. But all this beauty cannot last forever and so endgame came along, which was advertised quite nicely, from what I recall, as having the most of the superheroes engaged in. Weeeelll, that's the start of all the trouble I had with the movie.
  </p>

  <p>
    I mean, it was made to satisfy the masses, everybody, from the younger to older generations. By involving a bazylion of puns, references to speak to every single person across the audience, it's um... how should I put it, if you're trying to design something for everyone, usually it does not excel in any direction, that's the end of the story, quite universal law (forgot what was the original name for thou tho). The audience would laugh at key moments, start clapping whenever something epic happened. And I would remain in the theater, being like: yeah, yeah, yeah, ok but why I am watching this for in the first place? Is it just for the pure enjoyment of seeing the actors enact scenes in which they makes stuff funny or sad or whatever? Just for the sake of the superheroes and the entire hype raised for the sole purpose of keeping the monstruous moneymaking machine which marvel movies are spinning? Which if, superheroes really existed, would have been challenged by all those superheroes in the first place? Surprisingly, I am a bit more of a fan of the DC productions nowadays as they feel as if made a bit more complete and polished. Bleak too, perhaps that's what I'm after, which would make sense why I enjoyed Infinity War so much. I am always for productions that try to excel in certain forms, this one did not but was nevertheless correct in the form it tried to deliver.

  <center><h4>John Wick 3</h4></center>

  <p>
    Nowadays all of a sudden everybody loves Keanu Reeves. Why do they love him so much? Perhaps because he lost a dog and a wife, and a car, and decided to deliver some smacking to all those who kinda contributed to give Keenu some smacking. Ever since, he keeps smacking in John Wick 2, which I felt a bit underwhelmed by. Despite all the action, it kinda felt dry often. But it was still quite enjoyable and surprisingly I gave a higher rating for this one. I don't remember why. Then came John Wick 3 and people, friends, critics handed out some recommendations. I was like, naaaah I don't wanna go and watch this in the cinema. And then I did go and watch this. With no remorse. Except for the cinema I decided to pack my two legged body into.
  </p>

  <p>
   There's kinda more of everything here and better in many lengths, in most cases. There is certainly a lot of action happening with absolutely gorgeous choreography adapted aptly to the environment these took place in. The level of creativity in terms of how all of those were executed were really stimulating and how all shifted between each of those different settings, all things considered the drive of the show would not tire the audience out by repetitive scenes. I also enjoyed the scenography, at times absolutely majestic and especially after my recent exchange in New York, I absolutely loved how specific neighbourhoods were portrayed. I also praise the variety and again, I must stress, the creativity imbued into all this. It's just so nice. All in all there's lots, kept in great style and I left the movie satisfied (except for the cinema).

  <center><h4>Music Recommendations</h4></center>

  <p>
    This year seems to be particularly great in terms of music on its own. I'm using concurrently Google Play Music and Spotify as I grasped really nice deals to be in, in case of both those. And so, I kind of discover music with both as well. There are some really good albums that it pointed me towards, for which I am kinda thankful, as much as a person can be thankful for a service well-delivered, which kinda is a bit different in case of both, surprisingly. I'll put together a seperate blog on both. I should do it soon.
  </p>

<p>Jambinai - ONDA</p>

<p>
  An extremely atmospheric... I don't even know what it is. They use a variety of instruments to create, I guess post-rock but hell. It's beautiful, it suddenly becomes heavy. It's composed flawlessly. It's light and heavy. It's as if folk music but then it's definitely not. As if a soundtrack and then goes as if folk black metal but it's not. Melodic vocals comes at times to support the overall atmosphere. The mix is also great.
</p>

<p>Dream Theater - Distance Over Time</p>

<p>
  It would seem the one of the more notorious progressive metal bands are back and producing solid music once again. It's intricate, as usual but also at the same time just as well-composed as enjoyable. There are some bit more catchy ones but overall, prog can feel a bit boring for the ones who are not familiar with the genre. This one here can be approached, I feel by anyone, as it's a bit of a combination of heavy and more refined forms.
</p>

<p>Thank You Scientist - Terraformer</p>

<p>
  Weellll, I discovered them a while ago. The thing is, you can get tired a bit of this jazz/metal fusion quite fast. But hell if this album is just not simply just fantastically composed and the blast it delivers with a number of pieces. I enjoyed it so much. The mix is also exceptional.
</p>

<p>
  Other than this, Ling Tosite Sigure released a quite ok album that kinda grows as like any other of what they do, intricate post-harcore #5 album. Rammstein didn't quite deliver what I asked for, although a few songs from Deutschland are actually quite good, their style is unchanged from what I see, keeping themselves controversial in a good way of controversial. Pro8l3m released a new album Widmo which feels a bit more catchy but not necessarily as interesting as their former productions. Although, the instrumentals keep the highs as usual. Black River Humanoid was okay, a decent comeback. Man with a Mission Chasing the Horizon was very enjoyable. Health came out with a great VOL4 ꞉꞉ SLAVES OF FEAR and Periphery didn't quite blow me away with Periphery IV: Hail Stan. Babymetal is coming out with something soon, which seems very promising. Filter is coming back soon. Nine Inch Nails came out with the last third, experimental CD Bad Which which was okay. I also know I'm reaching into 2018 and so I should involve a bit more productions here but I'll refrain from going further. I just should've shared more, a bit more often.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
