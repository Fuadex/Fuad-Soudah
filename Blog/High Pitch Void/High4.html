    <center><h4>Fiend Clustered</h4></center>
    I've never really concealed my fascination for interactive media, especially video games. This is a medium that used to be quite frowned upon back in Poland when I played but not quite everyone did during my primary school years. Primarily as I thought due to misunderstanding what was being showcased on the screen, which wasn't much at the time. Basic graphics did not encourage but in certain cases it is the imagination that projects the rest. And then the gameplay which was just simply fun.<br><br>

    Now in turn I frown upon video games as it became a goldmine treated overly as a typical business directed towards milking its audience. As a designer I see the necessity to base off well established solutions ie. gameplay mechanics but I strongly contest the yearly bland releases that just bring nothing to the table. Pure, mindless stimulation.<br><br>

  <center><h4>What Remains of Edith Finch?</h4></center>

 	That's one of the reasons for which I keep away from all this. There just simply wasn't much that would trigger a wow-response. More like, it's all been seen before. To make matters worse, many video games seem to have received overly positive reviews but once I approached them, all the fame and glory seemed to be just a pumped pile of... well, nothingness. Far away from the expectations generated. And of course there was the matter of me just not having the exactly proper equipped to play on the go, or time for that matter. But it's healthy to keep your attention peeled to a culture and so I decided it's high time for me to maybe get back to it?<br><br>

 	I started off with an indie game in such case. What Remains of Edith Finch. I picked that up as I think I saw some results from the British Game Awards or something like that, the list of which seemed... reliable for a change with some titles known to me, while others just managed to fly under my radar. A swift research made prompted me to try it out. Walking simulators ain't exactly my thing but it ain't not in certain conditions. This one put me right into the game. I had to change a few settings and off I went wandering through the wilderness and discovering a... house. That sounds bland now, doesn't it?<br><br>

 	So let's start off that I prize a good narration and feel built with a good character inscenisation (staging). I loved the dialogues incorporated into Firewatch and the quality seems to be close-knit, except these are mostly monologues but the warmth and depth is utterly convincing along with the great voicing altogether. The environments are also quite beautifully crafted. The outside area and especially the interiors. Some parts are a bit lacking like the low-res skybox and the filters go awry at times but these are really minor issues. The level of polish and detail that went into crafting the interiors of Edith's house are, I'd say actually mesmerising. I would have loved to live and grow up in such environment, I don't know what kind of resources are needed to come up with such coherence and heartful finish but this here is absolutely wonderful, especially for an indie game. But this can't be enough to get a positive review in the end now does it (n)or should it?<br><br>

 	I was close to giving it around 7-8/10 but then once the additional storylines crawled in, I was literally put into an awe state. There is so much that can be done with mechanics but here the creators were able to deliver a stunning appearance of a Théâtre de l'absurde. Just the fruitful, surrealistic execution made it absolutely captivating to follow. Absolutely is an overstatement but the successful experimentation is very highly valued on my end, crossovering coherent and yet highly fictional storytelling, artistic expression and styling, a bit novel gameplay mechanics, all translating into one great immersion. There was also one adjacent story that cemented my view on this game, which combined it all + involving additional devices to evoke emotions. This is the type of game that got me fascinated about this medium and I am very happy to have been acquainted with it.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Bioshock Infinite</h4></center>
    I approached this game with a certain dose of restraint. This is a good thing, sometimes I get so hyped about something that eventually it turns against me and makes really, really disappointed. So once I approached this game, also after doing a quick research and discovering that it is somehow very valued by a variety of communities, I figured that with clear conscience I can play this and perhaps it will match storytelling-wise the Indie game that so much put my hopes high. I played the original game and that was truly a marvel, atmosphere-wise, narration-wise, gameplay too actually. It all morphed into one particularly immersive experience that had a twist that took the audience and reviewers by storm. I mean how do you get so many GOTY titles when in 2007 you had nothing but good games on the market in numbers that made some of them financially unsuccessful?<br><br>

    Well, I'll tell you maybe the distinction between what made that game so great and why does Bioshock Infinite remain on the opposite side. First of all, world-building. Fact, Infinite has an interesting styling and art-wise I can't say much against it. A quite tasty mix of steampunk, Bioshocky styling, religion and... well, it is a thing on its own actually. But the problem is, that it is all artificial. Sure, there are many NPCs and they talk to each other. But you can't interact much with them. Sure you're leading a character, who has a voice, who has a face, who does things and is animated. But many of the lines he speaks just do not connect. Compared to original bioshock, which felt much more down-to-earth. You were on a plane. You crashed. You enter a underwater dystopia that went mad and you need to survive through it all, guided by someone. This too was relatively far-fetched but believeable enough and provided some goals for the character to follow and created specific links that evolved throughout the game. It was still very much interaction-based but the underworld was also very compellingly crafted and the level of immersion was dense. Infinite, unfortunately, does not introduce you to the world properly. I didn't know why I was there. I didn't know where I was going. Nothing was really explained to the player for way too long and that just kicks you out of immersion. Along with an alive now but very much unnatural world.<br><br>

    To make matters worse, it is a very gameplay-centric game. There is plenty of shooting and Bioshocky mechanics that just do not feel very good actually. The extra magic stuff happening is kinda cool but I don't feel the magic coming out of the gameplay. Sometimes the game even forces you to play through the same maps back and forth. The construct feels also unnatural with the stealth/action split. We are given the ability to scavenge and look into every single corner of the world but what for? It just slows down the gameplay and again, put you off away from the immersion. These are huge criticisms as at this stage I am saying that both the gameplay and the story just do not live up to the quality. It feels rather generic which is just simply not good enough.<br><br>

    But then there are some elements that work. Some characters and voice acting are decent. Elisabeth, despite that I was not quite told exactly why I was looking for her (or even that I was looking for her) is a very interesting character and a, while very easy narrative hook, I knew exactly what 2K had in mind by introducing that interestingly written character into the game and how easily that could refract emotionally on the players, it is also a very interesting addition from the mechanical perspective as she will find additional resources in the game, create sort of strategic helpers for the player in the environment and provide some insightful comments that build her character further, primarily personality but also just the dialogues themselves are fruitful. Although sometimes they are detached in the game between live-action and cutscenes which I'm finding eerie. So far it's not a bad game. It's just not as good and some people bring this up and I agree with them.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Your Lie in April</h4></center>
    I admit, I got into the series because I saw the artwork on Netflix, clearly distinguishing itself from all the rest. It's quite surprising for me to say these words I mean, Anime live off artworks. If those are not done well, then why would anyone want to watch those series? I think I'm at some wrong here and I guess there is some hidden truth that I did not discover. And hey! I watched Erased also solely basing off the artwork presented which struck me as interesting and oh boy, what a dissapointment was the story. But I still found some value in it. And this show seemed to generate quite a traffic on myanimelist. Plus it seemed to incorporate a few interesting themes which I was intrigued to discover.<br><br>

    Let's start with what I particularly hated about this series. I can't say hated, this is a word that seems a bit too strong but still I am not used to watching a Sittendrama, okay, let's call it a soap opera, despite it's not quite one. I'm surprised I can't find the appropriate translation for this. But imagine a contemporary soap opera condensed to a short 22-episode long series, all drawn and animated, created obviously by the Japanese. Something that anyone can watch, a family watch. Kids will be dazzled. Adults will be drawn... by the music and inspirational touches. Let's get back later to the pros, though. The problem I had with this series and it actually extends to quite a few other Animes are, what I would call as, comedy twists. These are particularly annoying as they totally disregard the styling of the show and introduce rapid, extreme deviations and exaggerations that in my personal opinion, are just overly cringy and kick you out of immersion. The common link between everything happening is lost, the nuances are disregarded the subtleties are thrown out the window. That having said, I see the potential to dazzle the younger audience with such and it just may be a cultural thing. The artstyle is still quite nice, though. But the story lacks and is quite adolescent at its semi-best. So what kept me watching?<br><br>

    I like to watch average shows at times but acclaimed by some to see what they see in it. This show stood quite high in the rankings and I think I saw why. What the creators managed to accomplish was the incorporation of primarily, two features: the music part and as I'd call it, the lively life part. The music is not quite simple. It's classical. Piano and Violin. And you'll hear of this plenty but what is actually really good and here I'm speaking as a person who doesn't know too much about technicalities of music, is that it extends to quite a few authors and the very same plays are featured in interestingly distinct styles that intertwine with a narrative. I really enjoyed seeing the mesmerising intertwine between music and having it used as a narrative device to such an extent and putting an emphasis on how it correlates with emotions and many details that may remain hidden from people not familiar with such music all-in-all. It kinda makes you want to play a piano, a violin or pick up an instrument. That is an accomplishment on its own.<br><br>

    The other part is the lively life part. There are many plot threads happening, most of 'em very adolescent-grade. A bit about love, a bit about goals, accomplishments etc. etc. But I think it worked quite interestingly nicely here. Drilling into the inspiration part. Drilling into the times when you just can't get stuff done. Drilling further into the nature of inspiration, idols and what makes you you and what makes someone a shadow of himself. The power of memories, hardwork but I think it all came down to inspiration and creations of things that can be beautiful in so many different ways. Dazzling in so many different ways. Such thoroughness and depth is something that needs to be brought out here as such elements can save an otherwise quite average show. I guess it's all about the details and something that you have not seen often, much at all, experienced but is just simply amazing.<br><br>
