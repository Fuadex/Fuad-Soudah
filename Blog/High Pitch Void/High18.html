    	There has been plenty of stuff that I have seen lately. I hardly kept track of all but I think it is worth mentioning, that I thought there is a limited amount of movies and shows to watch that are worth grabbing my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      You quickly find yourself realising how wrong you are once you set yourself upon the world of vpn, scouring alternative multiverses of contents offered by the very same products you are subscribed to: Netflix and Amazon Prime. And then some, that is virtually not really offered anywhere, currently.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that's all fine. In the end there is still stuff to watch and perhaps contemplate? I also sidestepped into the world of books, discovering some really great stories and some bit less, nevertheless, a bit eye-opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Question is, how much can I store in my head?

	  <center><h4>Let's do this one a bit differently - Studio Ghibli</h4></center>

  <p>
It's no secret Ghibli movies hit Netflix a few months back. Pretty big deal, huh? Wasn't much for me, as I often saw Ghibli movies more often as a feast for families. Well, I've proven myself wrong to some extent. Perhaps the reason is that I've started watching really from the wrong part (the part that interests me less overall): Howl's Moving Castle (I think this was my first, kinda liked it actually), My Neighbour Totoro (less), Spirited Away (not much actually). But hey, since the covid situation, I guess it was time to hit the bed, chair or whatever and do a bit of a binge through the rest. A-ha, I also saw Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and this one I actually enjoyed quite much, what stood out to me when I watched this one was a few things: the bit different, oldschool yet amazing soundtrack and... that WWF supported this movie, which was reflected fairly strongly in the movie's characters' motivations, in short worldbuilding. And then there was also Grave of the Fireflies, an expected tear-jerker, one of those heavy movie, animation-features of the kind that are, I'll risk stating, are rare due to animation still kinda having the patch of a 'kids stuff' status. Not at all, I don't think I jerked any tears after seeing this one but it kinda proves Ghibli isn't a one-way kids-time but even when it is, Ghibli seemed to incoporated elements that does entertain all age groups altogether. Oh, I also saw Princess Mononoke - also great but that's all I'll say for now :)
  </p>

  <p>
    So I've started my Netflix Ghibli binge from Porco Rosso, after having read a bit on some interesting animation features. This one surprised me already with a few things: superB quality of animation, the wit and attention to detail, not just in regards to how the feature was built altogether but how it drew an amass of references from Italy it was based on and its historical references. This is a great indicator of what I was met with afterwards, moving forward with Ghibli. There were animations that I saw less in, which were more feel-good stories in which animation quality drove the movies' pride such as Kiki's Delivery Service or Tales for Earthsea, Whisper of the Heart which still had some very interesting elements such as how magical elements interacted with the surrounding environment, people etc. And some that were kept a bit more down to earth with emphasis I suppose put on human-longings and age like Just Yesterday, Ocean Waves, From Up on Poppy Hill. And some that binded some of the best of all, magical, everyday, interactions between the depicted environment itself but achieved varying degrees of good quality: When Marnie was There, Arrietty, Ponyo. It's surprising how even features that kind of seem boring at first glance, still have elements that show artistry and craftsmanship in engaging the audience. And up untill now, these Ghibli movies were at the very least good and very diverse already. But here we go for my personal favourites (not counting some of the classics I've watched years prior).
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's pull up canons of a lesser diameter: The Wind Rises, a complete story of a guy who came up with Zero planes. I expected a bit more after this, as the concept felt heavy but the focus was rather placed on the main character's dedication to the concept of flight and the process of its creation that went through his life, with bit less or not so less subtle references to the destruction it would create. It pulls emotional strings and feels quite complete as a full feature. The Cat Returns was a bit of a surprise to me, as I genuinely really enjoyed it. Despite being a notch down-to-earth, it really grew on me as it felt like a bit loose adaptation of Alice in the Wonderland, which had some very dark elements imbued in it - again, surprise and some mild, although, really mild?; moral dillemas, for appropriately lesser caliber but then again, packaged in a wonderful animation style. The Castle of Cagliostro a wonderful debut of Miyazaki pre-Ghibli, which all I'll say was very detailed, culturally rich (felt like San Marino) and very engaging. Which brings me to... about 5 that were really really my favourites. Hard to choose just one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start from Castle in the Sky. Phenomenal oldschool soundtrack like in Nausicaa. Absolutely phenomenal animation which stuns with attention to detail and perfect craftsmanship. It might just be really the most detailed animation from Ghibli that I've seen actually. Very strong concepts converging between militarism, industry and nature. Beautiful conceptual, close to steampunk-type universe, witty and strikes a perfect balance between being a movie for all across kids and adults alike. Pom Poko, another surprise, which mixes, he-he, everything. It's so densely packed with content that I'm not sure even where to begin. It takes the audience through time through the perspective of animals. There's a lot in terms of treatment of environment by humans and its severely negative impact of construction-work, crossed with Japanese religion and beliefs, cross-political considerations of government forms and how they relate to its society. Society-growth from varying perspectives, superstition. Somehow, somewhat, they managed to pack everything into this very neat package and more, which is content-wise beautiful to enjoy.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I left two more animations, which I believe are primarily taken care of Isao Takahata - so not the Miyazaki, who's most famous from Ghibli. Takahata did also Grave of the Fireflies and Pom Poko and also Only Yesterday which I enjoyed much less. But these titles should already give a bit of a direction on what to expect, as these movies do diverge a bit from the general Ghibli canon. My Neighbors the Yamadas. In theory, it's not much of a great content to be found, as it's almost only but just merely a slice of life story. But what makes it truly exceptional is, two things. Its animation style which is all cartoony in a more caricature-like style and watercolor/crayony overall. I have a weakspot for animation that is realised differently, so there's that, it's a visual feast. The other part is just how freakin' razor-sharp relateable this slice of life is. It's just purely amazing how relateable it is, considering it seems predominantly based on the Japanese family relations but most interactions I could easily connect with despite having been brought up in Europe. Lots of it communicated subliminally, it's all again in sorts packed just like Pom Poko.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm not sure if I would give this one my absolute Ghibli favourite but it certainly deserves a big fucking praise. I mean, hey! Would you like to watch a painted animation feature film? I mean sure, most of Ghibli movies already feature painted environments, duh. But what about painted in a seriously traditional-style, as if you were watching an actual traditional-Japanese paintings in motion, the sorts that were painted in watercolor (?) on bamboo sheets with slight pencil exaggeration? The Tale of Princess Kaguya is just exceptional visually, a massive feast for eyes and just receives a massive individual praise from my side for going bold this direction. It doesn't come short just with the visuals, though, as the story is compelling on its own, being stretched across time and dealing with the traditional feudal Japenese relations and present mechanisms of the time.</p>

    <p>
      All in all, what I really enjoyed while going through Ghibli movies, was that the creators often aimed at achieving something more than just an animation. In the end, it's merely a creative device, form of an expression - as I believe. And they were really good at pursuing something more, stretching out the limits and/or becoming the leaders in what could be squeezed out from those limits and providing a very diverse artistic setting.

	  <center><h4>Other Animation</h4></center>

  <p>
  	Whaaat, you figured I'd keep my foot of the pedal? No Sir! I went through more animation features in my last few months. Let's take a look at two that apparently are old and... sad. Take note, we'll be going some international movies. Watership Down and The Plague Dogs, two british classics. First one that I've taken for a spin - pacing in conjunction with the dialogues and animation is so natural and fluid. That with a bit of overarching human and animal-centric perspective amalgamated deftly into one and a bit of madness spice makes it a quite enjoyable watch, one of being on the verge of a children's and an adult tale. Fairly brutal, so moving towards more naturalistic and hence adult-directed tale. The Plague Dogs went quite darker. And I felt a bit less of, perhaps due to my expectations. The story is a tad slow in progression but it brings out some strong concepts, of 'masters', survival, freedom and animal cruelty. Despite the story progression, the ending did end up with me shedding tears. Sometimes it's about the feature coming to an emotional boom at its end, as there is a journey, which might be underwhelming but how it concludes can take you apart.
</p>

<p>
  Back to Japan. Belladonna of Sadness - Every now and then, you come across a masterpiece. Even rarer, a masterpiece that after 15 minutes of seeing which, you're decisive it's a 10/10 and there's nothing else like it. This is such a visually absolutely stunning animation and the work of art, being at the same an erotic that fills you with dread up till you burst in into tiny little shiny shattered pieces. I would pay money to see stills from this movie in any given museum. It would be a wonderful addition to any institution, as the art is so profoundly beautiful and so and as it is very, very cruel. So cruel and heavy that I had to put myself at ease and reschedule to finish the remaining 2/3 of the movie at another time. And yet, it is so, so, gorgeously beautiful. Remember when I mentioned The Tale of Princess Kaguya? Well, this movie put the exceptional visuals bar so profoundly high that it will take a while since I'll see something reach even close to how amazing visually this one is.
</p>

<p>
  Ok, this one's German! Falidae ,makes me regret I didn't watch it in its original language and sure, it follows some tropes but the overall feel is very western-like, with pretty solid writing and in the end it is sort of a detective story. Not so dark and gruesome as some might say but it's got its thriller vibey and wasn't expecting this from a country I spent a year in. How about MFKZ? This one's French (I think a French-Japanese co-production). As I was vpn hoppin', I noticed NZ Netflix had a cool cover. Yeah, sometimes my attention gets drawn to covers, cause, honestly, so many productions look like a copy and paste. Where's the flair in all that? So after I looked it up, gave it a go. A movie with truly brilliant dialogues. Definitely aimed at the American audience and sadly, it seemed to have gone greatly under the radar. With its wits, a multitude of cultural references and pretty tasty action sequences, I'm pretty happy I've given it a go. More french? Well April and the Extraordinary World was pretty good. Cool steampunk world, nice dialogues and worldbuilding. Perhaps it lacked a bit of an additional artistic touch but it still remained a good watch. American? World of Tomorrow - It's not really a majestic piece but it's short, it's been nominated for an oscar and it has some nice visuals and concepts. Well, it's a bit of an animation binge I'm going through too, what's there more to tell? I guess Iranian/French? Persepolis - Surprisingly complete story, which competently juggles between being funny and sad. Thought-provoking and educational. A tale, to which everyone can relate, with an exceptional coverage of its surrounding socio-political events. Criticism and commentary mingles with satire and tragedy in this predominantly monochromatic world, parts of which extend to our own. French/Czechoslovakian? Fantastic Planet - I think I just ran out of animated classics. I must have, if I watched this one. Weird, a very, very weird one. There is a fantastic theme right there and it's a French-Czechoslovakian classic from 1973, so I should give it some slack but I just didn't buy its style. An interesting take on a dystopia, though. Classic as hell. American-Canadian? Heavy Metal was an interesting spin, felt very crude as an animation and the style it was produced in, it'd be heavily criticised nowadays due to its outdated cultural concepts. But in all its crudeness and bit of an anthological mess, it was a decent watch.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, let's take another look at Japanese stuff. Robot Carnival - ah, Anthologies, anthologies... always fond of them. From Black Mirror, Love Death and Robots to Neo Tokyo. A chance to excel for some of the more creative minds out there. Even if you get a bit less performant episode, chances are you'll still get to see something totally original, brilliant and pushing the boundaries of what you know and experienced. Does this one do so? Well... yes and no. Some of its themes shocking, others dandy and some constitute of a mix. In the end, just as any anthology, it's a feast. Memorizu - From the guy, who worked on Akira but for some reason, I preferred his other works, this one included. It's not really particularly phenomenal but the stories that consist of the entire whole are well crafted, solidly developed, shine off with bits of brilliance, distinct enough and they keep your eyes peeled with interest. Lovin' this type. Metropolis - This one I've been postponing for weeks. I mean, speaking of dystopias, can I still dig out something worth-a-while? Oh, very yes. Weird character aesthetics, yet, increasingly gorgeous cinematography and honestly a delightful tale. It's got a fair bit of breadth and depth, satisfying story progression and conclusion, and it very positively surprises the audience further on. Redline - Speaking of backlogs, a friend forwarded me thing a while ago. Since it's a movie, ain't nobody got time, right? Well, as I was skimming through what I could watch I planned on rolling through some animated classics and.. eh, gave it a couple of seconds and figure, why not. And it was a good decision, exhilarating movie, some cool visual sequences, an Armageddon of detail reigning over tons of sequences - considering it's an animation, this elevates it to impressive level. Got a few tidbits which don't matter much, had lots of fun regardless.
</p>

<p>
  Fantasia - It's not often that you come across an animated feature, in which it is not the animation that takes the lead but the soundtrack itself. Unbelievably refreshing, for a movie from the 1940 it holds up incredibly well. And looking back as a kid being brought to see ballets and operas and whatnot (where I'd often sleep through the 3-4h long spectacles), seeing this combination today just makes me happy. As the show is a portrayal of classics, with its backstories and everything under one.

  <p>
Avatar: The Last Airbender - When I was a kid (like a kid kid), I watched maniacally cartoons, whether Cartoon Network or Disney Channel. I mean, it was the golden age, right? One network I would always skip, was nickelodeon and that held up over the years, as I really felt it had nothing to offer (even from a kid's point of view) and that kind of translated into me not willing to give this Avatar ago, despite I picked it up here and there. And it was fantastic. Goofy but incredibly educational (not counting the obvious general disregard for physics) and what really surprised me was it didn't necessarily make an effort in holding back from topics that I'd consider heavy, although it would spin out frequently, especially in 3rd season. That's okay, wanna go heavier? Well, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood feels like a not-so-distant cousin. And that's a big compliment, since it still tops at my "best anime" list and art-wise (and not just), these two have crazy a lot in common.
</p>

<p>
  Legend of Korra - Oh how happy was I when I discovered that there is a sequel to Avatar. But as kids grow, so does the sequel, with a new, teen Character. Which drives off a bit plot-wise towards more teeny melodrama but not altogether. First season seemed to have got a massive money bump, since the painted quasi-steampunk environments made my mouth water and the animation was of truly exceptional quality. Seasons 2 and 3 dropped ball appropriately but all across there were great educational elements relatively sustained from Avatar and making the show overall a very enjoyable watch. It involves political concepts in a bit broader and detailed manner without necessarily imposing a set view, which I welcomed with open arms. If someone was on the lookout for something anime-like but really western-based, well, here's Nickelodeon producing out this gem.
</p>

<p>
  Undone - I follow Tomek Baginski and literally whatever this guy recommends is always worth a peek. This kinda extends onto the polish gamedev dinosaurs anyways. Great writing and acting, nice artstyle especially when it blends different effects. Bit cringy which would hold me aback at times and it's a slice of life thing but it's fairly short and the performances along with artstyle hold up.
</p>

<p>
  Bit of cyberpunk now. Gunnm, aka, Alita: The Battleangel but in its original anime form. You know, I took a look at the hollywood movie and I was like, um, kinda meh. The anime, however, what I like to see in this genre and at all when I consume media, is having a bit of a stronger emotional touch. Which can lift up even a rather standard, even if style-wise interesting anime. Serial Experiment Lain, wholy sheet what a weird anime. First of all, its structure is off (a bit) (maybe more a bit). Secondly, it very strongly resides in philosophical considerations, of, well, lots circulating around the meaning of life and what it means once its starting to move to the virtual sphere. The visual style is often unsettling and ominous and it doesn't really lead to anything particularly surprising but... you know, some folks tend to say this is a predecessor of Matrix and hey, I think they're right.
</p>

<p>
  Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - ha, found on Japanese Netflix with English subtitles which is a surprise. The bigger surprise laid elsewhere, though. The original GITS I guess built its legend based on its highly philosophical nature and and rather sleek yet raw appeal. It was a bit too short, though, yet still a great watch. I figured the rest of the franchise would not stand up to its legend and... I think the first season of Stand Alone Complex did. The problem which remained throughout was its TV-Show-like feel, quite often standardised, there was a strong need to explain stuff by its end etc. But there usually was at least one particularly interesting concept in each episode, with depicted cases becoming stretched out skillfully in terms of what the creators wanted to convey. Action-scenes often felt tasty but even tastier were the ideas dissolved and stirred up to become what it became - something more than just a regular watch, biting at your feelings when needed, making you laugh and sad for the complex realities the depicted characters fell into. Plus, a huge ass cherry on top - the truly exceptional soundtrack which elevated it all and pushed it even further. I'm not saying this show is absolutely magnificent but it exceeded my expectations, even if 2nd season (2nd gig) drops ball on the tastier philosophical cyberpunk approach and instead settles for a typical action-based intrigues, which the show leaned towards in its 1st season but happily extended beyond.

    <p>
Better Call Saul S5 - ..yyea, I didn't plan on coming back soon just as BCS didn't for 2 years now (I guess El Camino took a swing at production, eh?). In part, I'm kind of glad I got back, since the folks behind have a very nice way of directing their stuff. Lots of subtleties encapsulated, great performances but Saul's character feels insignificant, which in part aligns with the show's idea but it transcends into a feeling of blandness on its audience counterpart.
  </p>

  <p>
Firefly - I had a couple of swings at sci-fi shows, there's... not that many, which makes sense, considering how much $$ would need to go to FX. And you can see it in Firefly how oldschool much of it looks like but peeps were telling me it's a classic and since I ain't got anything left of The Expanse and Star Trek feels like from an outer galaxy, I hopped in. And it's not bad. You can smell it aged, with an exaggerated focus on characters and a standardised approach to the TV Show convention. But it's got some writing brilliance hidden in it, so there's some value.
  </p>

  <p>
Into The Night - Whatever Tomek Baginski lays his hands on, I'm in. What can pop out of, from, I heard, a few lines of text from a Polish sci-fi author? Apparently a Belgian TV show. Its fair depth and format can be compared to Lost but overall, it's just simply a great watch. Quite fascinating cultural fusion, as multiple languages are blended seamlessly into this. Finally a title, in which multiculturalism doesn't feel forced. And to top it off with a short, concentrated accent: Amazingly intertwines meticulous attention to detail and subtleties in a drive to tell, this time, a more focused yet a refined story reflecting on the macrocosm of a complex, multilayered universe. This is my personal the end of the year favourite.
  </p>

  <p>
    Westworld S2 - Astonishing writing. One of the very few shows which managed to pull off several parallel plotlines with different timeframes and keep itself coherent, engaging and powerful. Fantastic acting, marvellous dynamically adapting soundtrack, gorgeous scenography. Enormous depth of the depicted world with vast cultural references, buried under a heavy blanket of very harrowing scenes and a very average season wrap up. Overall, I was extremely pleasantly surprised with this one and I'm sad to see that S3 is a far cry from how good S1 and S2 were. I wonder what went wrong. Have the hosts gone rogue?

  <p>
Limes Inferior - I never really was a book person, which makes me feel like an ass every now and then. I mean, to get hooked on it, it feels like hard work at times and even audiobooks do not necessarily help as you kind of need to concentrate to persevere through normally over 200-pages long titles. That's a fuckload that translates into whoopin' looong hours of listening material!</p>

<p>I've gone through the dystopian 4 of Orwell, Huxley, Bradbury and Zamyatin and.. now that I think about it, which ass did I pull this "dystopian 4" from? So I did a quick google search. And hey! Turns out I know more of it than I previously have thought! Even if in adapted formats. But in all of the quick search results, Limes Inferior was nowhere to be found. Well, I shouldn't be surprised.</p>

<p>..but knowing the other books' backgrounds and the aforementioned equivalents, Limes Inferior as a dystopia feels the closest to the contemporary reality and the author serves it in a surprisingly accessible and deftly written fashion. It's really striking just how much alike this nearly 40-years old world feels. I was looking for something like this, it really does beat its competition and I would love to see an adaptation as its formula feels like a perfect match for a blockbuster tv show.
  </p>

  <p>
    Limelight and Citizen Kane. I might have to take a closer look at older movies. Limelight was a Charlie Chaplin movie but, you know, I guess the guy was quite famous for... comedy, right? Well, this movie doesn't seem much like so. More of an... hm. Heartfelt ode to the time of greatness? A bit of a story of redemption? Bit of a journey from being a failure to gaining success? Or more like... a window into the concept of life, with one showing that it's definitely worth living through and making the best out of it? It's got a few weirder moments but overall, yeah, solid and quite emotional classic that is with much for the author to convey to its audience. And Citizen Kane, an all-time classic, I was wondering what I'd find. And what I found was... a surprising twist, fairly chaotic structure that still kept at its seams and made sense. Galloping plot that slowly unravelled and had mysteries of its kind. The movie felt quite fresh and playful in terms of how it was directed. I can clearly see why it's an all-time classic. One thing is to break rules but another is to do it masterfully, which transcends not only into direction but also into figuring out what the characters were and why they've done what they've done.

  <p>
Man, I don't even know if I should cover this one. Every now and then you end up watching a movie that, I mean, there's nothing bad about watching it. Except that it doesn't necessarily need a review. Here we have Kick-Ass, sequel of it. I mean the original was kinda fun to watch, concentrating on someone who decided to become a superhero, cause why not. The sequel kinda, well, continues this. And it extends in some ways but overall feels a bit trite and lacking, well, much in everything. But, you know, it's enjoyable so I'll just leave it at that.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
