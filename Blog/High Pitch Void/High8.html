    <p>This time of the year. Bit of keto. Bit of struggling, what to do with myself? Oh wait, actually that's no longer. See, it's a fine state, except it feels like many changes will ascend in the next few months and very likely coming years. This is the last alarm, ringing and giving me a glimpse of a future in which I may no longer impose changes according to what I'd like to achieve. As there will be no longer time and I will be kept busy with all the other stuff, even more likely - called life.</p>

    <p>So, until that happens, I marched on a failed rampage with keto by downing myself to a sweet 73.5 in a bit over two weeks, only to discover this was a bit of a failed keto attempt but hey! I managed to do so much. And I continue to do so in bursts, sometimes it startles me what I am doing to myself but all these means serve an end and so far I didn't manage to reach the breaking point. Oh wait, I did already? It's remarkable how a human body can fix itself, provided with the right environment.</p>

  <center><h4>Attack on Titan</h4></center>

  <p>Season 1</p>

  <p>I'd say at times it's remarkable to come across shows which upon its entry, you become so dissatisfied with what you've experienced that you can't help but get back watching and eventually enduring the first painful but then quite increasingly pleasant experiences. That's what happened with Code Geass, which became incredibly good, although still within the very good threshold with season 2 but how it started got all sorts of negative comments spouting right through my keyboard, spamming whomever I felt most sharing my concerns with at the time. And now's the time for Attack on Titan and there are quite a few thoughts strolling through my mind. But I'll start from the beginning.</p>

  <p>The problem was.. um, actually there was no problem at the beginning. It rolled in with all its glory actually, beautiful scenery, gorgeous animation, very unique style... well, maybe not that unique but still the dirty blend conceived of medieval and fantasy elements... which one would call just purely might & magic but still as if some fine sort of mythodology implemented. And then going full berserk with no restraints whatsoever, daum it was a ride in which the extremes were definitely not held back. This is something that I do envy from the creators originating from the land of the rising sun, cherry blossoms and mind-melting sushi. They do stretch out the extremes too far though and that did take place with Code Geass, Attack on Titan and pretty much anything that originates from Japan but as always, even in the crowd of badly made decisions, there are some that will strike as something that you have not seen, as in that good, in quite sometime. Attack on Titan didn't really have any of those... with many elements that I disliked.. but it grew.</p>

  <p>What did I dislike, though? First of all, the overly cringy characters (oh how I love to remark the cringiness, fuck yeah!). Then the unbelieavable plot lines imbued, with reason but presented beyond except for the effects that took place, which may not make sense at this point. Imagine characters who are driven by a purpose based on an event that took place in their story. The drive is justified by the event but the event itself is just way too far-fetched, not so much to dissolve the joy coming from the show but making it a notch painful watch. Then there are the titans themselves, who look as if they were just parodies or caricature. Perhaps seeing those eating people is something that kicks the sense of what you're perceiving but making a show to the point of being laughable while introducing a horde of elements skewed with seriousness does not serve as much value. Except, it is something novel. And in fact, the all seriousness in the end was presented, deployed very well. And even if there is more that I notch disliked, like diverting action to retrospection or annoying characters, all somewhat became moderate and helped me focus on what was good.</p>

  <p>And there was plenty of good, starting with the already mentioned bleak world filled with dirt. But the animation here was something from an almost long-gone dimension. It was so terrific and mesmerising to follow at times with so many details retained that it all just felt fluidly natural. I really enjoyed the world-building and the characters' development. It's a bit like Game of Thrones happening here but frankly, Attack on Titan delivers a much more natural and thought-out batch and drives the story in a way that you can't be sure of who will survive this. In fact, the entire world is made to be very fragile but still complex and I loved how it progressed and uncovered more details with coming episodes. The supporting auditory elements were prevalently stellar. The dynamism kept the show watchable and incredibly entertaining. And even the weaker elements could not mess with how much I enjoyed watching it, especially with the closing episodes. It was a show more worth of an 8 but the way it was ultimately delivered from start to finish, makes it a prime watch and a clear recommendation.</p>

    <p><center>9/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Season 2</p>

    <p>The same cannot be said about the season 2, though. Although, I must mention at this point that it didn't start so badly. In fact, most of the world's structure was retained with the extremely alike styling and characters too. I couldn't say that these two seasons were published in so different times which is a massive praise. So how the fuck did the creators manage to screw it up so badly halfway through? Let's see, new elements were introduced which were great. The progression was clear, the dynamism was there. Technically, all the characters and the story just took on from the first season. New fears and unknowns were introduced and many of the bad stuff was also retained which paradoxically projected for a clear 8/10 continuation. Which even the increasingly apparent defects could not entirely drive off. I counted at least 3 characters who had their personalities, at least slightly altered, as if to make them seem a bit more human. But even more of them became equalised. Normally that could work except Attack on Titan featured highly polarised archetypes which surprisingly worked in this convention, as the emphasis was put on the characters' drives rather than emotions per say. In anime there is a tendency to convey feelings and emotions to the point the viewer could barf. So this is the only explanation for which I could find what happened but this just drove the show to being more tendentious. In fact, many techniques were introduced which were just simply not present before, strengthening the other qualities of the show and its uniqueness but in addition, the show just shows how either the budget was cut or some other people were involved, as the animations also took a quality dive, not integrating so many nuances which I have loved in the first season.</p>

    <p>None of it all can compare to what happened mid-way in the season, though by introducing such a twist that it managed to obliterate a lot of what the show was actually good with. This was truly one of the worst twists I have experienced in the recent, at least months. And the way it was further driven... see, the good thing about shows where there are uncovered secrets is that it has good uncovered secrets that remain ambiguous and somewhat freightening. We want to know the answer behind but it's best we did not so that the world remains concise and within a prime set of integrity. This show unfortunately all threw out the window. From which point, everything started to literally just fall apart: the nuances, the details, the atmosphere, the structure and especially world-building and dialogues. You could still see this is Attack on Titan but the joy just evaporated and many structural parts of the show were meddled with, with Titans not being as difficult to address anymore. It's a shame, from an unforgiving and very unique universe, somewhat it all was steered towards... I don't even know to be frank, except I can only express the lows that I have experience and dissatisfaction for the course the what I would call, one of the best anime series has taken.</p>

    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Season 3</p>

    <p>Once again, the show kicks off properly by introducing a series of powerful schemata. Out of a sudden, the key characters regained their core personalities to a certain extent, which came as a very welcoming sight as finally it would have seemed the show was being restored to its glory. But with that, many flaws came along originating from season 1 and unfortunately 2 as well. To pinch in, there are hardly any titans in Attack on Titans this time. Instead, we receive a western-like blend and new intrigues that pushes on a 'till bit of freshness but also a grand confusion right in the middle of already stirred up clusterfuck with which this show became all thanks to the massive lame twist. We get something similar of grandeur but it doesn't lead anywhere and that's my main issue, especially that many of the newly introduced characters just lack the power that was conceived in season 1. In fact, much of the world's power and fears somehow managed to dissapate along the way, the fragility of the world, the particular bleak style of the show which made it truly unique in the crowd of schematic tv shows, which this title unfortunately attained. It did improve however in some episodes considerably, so you may give it a chance. But I just wish the show's creators could flash with just a bit of consistency because it just doesn't watch well when many elements begin showing contradictory elements defying rather itself and trying to become something that it's just not. In other words, the original had everything, all there's required is follow and concentrate on the world and its progression which is already in place. Once you start meddling with it, nothing interesting comes out, just a pulpy mess.</p>

    <center><h4>Ślepnąc od Świateł</h4></center>

    <p>Ohh... This was so difficult to find that it took almost a miracle for me to hunt it down. For some reason, HBO has better VPN-protection technologies than its competitors, which obviously turned against me, as I was not able to see any of it with my commercial NordVPN. Still, I managed to get my hands on this and see what's with the general appraisal of the polish community for a new production made by a guy I only know from... making a really good music video for a polish reggae band? If that's not already triggering alarms, then let me just add, that this was exactly which got me a bit excited for this show. In fact, I haven't really seen many overwhelmingly good polish tv shows for... well, as far as I can remember?</p>

    <p>And so the with the first minutes the series decided to impress me with stale acting and disattached scene combination. I figured, that's fine, this will soon kick off but as the show progressed, I realised a few things: first, that the color-grading feels below set expectations. That started to trigger some alarms, as the promotionals shots I've come across were stellar and what I was presented with, was somewhat, well, just as bland as the acting was. Turned out, my colour profiles got hijacked by one of the recent windows insider updates. Eventually I double checked and it was good, the arrangement of lightning all in all is quite impressive in this show. Not just that but the approach to inject continuous longshots. Note, this is a drama, I don't come across that often such directorship but it is extremely difficult to pull it all off well and unfortunately, in this show one can see how a combination of really good concepts get lost a bit in the crowd of. Well. As said, really good concepts but with mixed execution.</p>

    <p>Let's see. The main character doesn't strike as particularly interesting. His play is fine, there were many issues raised as if he was just bland. Sure he was but the role he was given seemed to be just as such, hence I cannot say much against him, except at times there is a specific feel of plasticity that comes and goes, nothing to be helped really. Then there are other actors who again range from very close, to if just plain incredible performance (Frycz!) to others who just do below expectations, mainly consisting of minor/supporting roles. Characterisation was kept to high standards, special effects were average. The storyline was surprisingly consistent, even if at times (although rarely) quite naiive. There were numerous supernatural sequences, stepping outside the formal drama-style of the show itself. The fine artsy parts felt overall mediocre, I just couldn't identify any values attached or anything that could contribute to the show itself, in fact it disrupted unnecessarily the flow. Some others were plain interesting, still disruptive but blended well with the crawling insanity that progressed with the show, finally something particularly interesting blended in! Which points towards another really good thing: the storyline is fairly, although not overly complex by the addition of a variety of characters who come through, vanish and happen again, all in consistent manner. It's nice to see a show, which does this well, there are no clearly defined protagonists and antagonists, the concept shifts smoothly throughout the show and concludes in a satisfactory manner.<br>
    (this is not a spoiler, I just stated I liked how the show came to its conclusion).</p>

    <p>I have mentioned previously of the disruptive scenes, as there were more and frankly, most of them felt obsolete. I understand the intentions and as I understand, the director/producer of this show has a tendency to introduce experimental features and perform a bit more ambitiously. All of this, I always welcome with my arms open wide. However, I can't help but notice the issues ruffling up the show, which are just plain production-related mistakes: badly handled camerawork, acting feeling mocky, stiff dialogues, at times unsynchronized soundtrack and tendencious sound effects. But despite it all, there is a lot of things happening in the show and overall, despite being fairly exaggerated in all directions in terms of how the reality is portrayed in the show it all feels... beliveable. I feel that's an accomplishment, the ability to keep the natural feel of it all, especially that I couldn't say any scene felt detached from the showcased reality at any inch. It's a very interesting watch and considering the number of elements imbued, it might bring more joy with subsequent binging.</p>

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
