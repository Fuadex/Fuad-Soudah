    <center><h4>Phantom</h4></center>
    Recently, I've equipped myself with a VPN. It was a last-call offering that I dug out from my facebook feed. Sometimes I wondered 'why the hell do I spend so much time on facebook. It's trash'. But I guess it's as trashy as you design your facebook feed and sometimes, gold will come out, just like with the VPN offer.<br><br>

    It was sort of a dream come true, as I questioned my subscription to Netflix. Now there is actually some stuff to watch from beyond the constrains of Australian selection. Despite I have research to do. But oh well. I also have a sense of emptiness recently and that was coming in hard so filling it up with a notch of illusion, well, I forgot but it did work in the past, didn't it? And so it did the trick now too.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Better Call Saul Season 4</h4></center>

 	<p>This is a prime example of how shows should be made. Despite this, the creators did not quite manage to invert the average characters, despite how they they performed and how many details were embedded. Still, I should state a few facts. I disliked the first season. But then again, the people behind Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad have a tendency to create loooong build-ups that last an entire season or even longer. I would praise the consistency, actors' performance and the action sequences, directed in impeccable, top-notch standards, even going through the roof and defining the new. And I would lash out at the mediocre family-related sequences that did not contribute much overall to the show. This remained a consistent issue throughout both the shows, sadly. But Better Call Saul did pick up on the throttle with season 2 as things sped up and somehow the creators managed to elevate the mediocrity of its weaker parts by imbuing complexity and depth into the characters' relations. Hard to achieve without the stellar performance of the protagonists but also the screenplay was written marvelously and the plot was thickened with parallel stories mixed with care.</p>

  <p>So did the third season do better? I'd say it did similarly to how season 2 went on to perform, although lacking in some areas, quite going forward in some others. Another area that makes the show stand out is the aesthetics and directorship, despite it is a drama, it involves a range of really engaging longshots composed in a beautiful manner. At times I would complain on the show being a notch too dark, funnily, as I use to post-process materials in a highly contrasty way, however here it went a bit too far even for my taste. The soundtrack was kept great, there was a bit of well executed action happening. Old actors from Breaking Bad and the new cast define how quality shows should be played. And what I also incredibly enjoy in Better Call Saul is how all the nuances and emotions are depicted in a very compelling way that truly connect to its audience without sacrificing a bit of creativity that's always there. There is a fair bit of plotlines thick with weird but highly (by the show) exploited themes, on a daily basis that would not gain any attention, the show always manages to capture them in an interesting way.</p>

  <p>Even if Better Call Saul does not really particularly excel, it is still a very decent watch. It also takes a bit of effort to create something out of nothing, as I used to describe Breaking Bad. The team responsible for the show does the job just simply very well and if anyone, including me had doubts whether these people could pull it off, well they did. Even if there is plenty of scenes that do not contribute too much to the show itself, it just simply watches well and has a quite bit of depth to it. This is not the peak of my dreams but it certainly revolves around.</p>

    <center><h4>Made in Abyss</h4></center>

    I don't really do watch series anymore now in one/two attempts. As in, I'll consume in its entirety, cause I practically have time to spare, although theoretically just none. This time I was still recovering from the recent lack of sleep, so I decided that I'll pick up on something. Attack on Titan felt a bit too cringy + it is a bit extensive. I took another bite at Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood but I've already seen that and heaps, it heaps is amazing show, although looks a bit less in its first span. Then Better Call Saul but it ain't the end just yet. I looked for Made in Abyss as it seemed like a trump card just hidden away on netflix and then I found out that it ain't there anymore. After a few Fuad-fu techniques employed I managed to find da way and here an amazing fairy tale world has shown its all semi-vibrant, more cartoonish-alike, crayony, at times paintingly colors. It's confusing, eh? But hey, it gets even more onwards, although not quite plotwise. It's just the mixing of contents, style, characters, what's included and what's being crossovered. This is simply quite amazing, although still not enough to make a killing just yet. But despite how the show looks like, it ain't one of those sweet cartoons, in fact it is far to the contrary.<br><br>

    As it is a story of adventure. Featuring characters seeking one, although for a set of very well portrayed reasons. A theme of journey, although one in which hardships take the lead. It is amazingly sweet, bit anime-grade perverted and unsettlingly cruel with the story's progression. I do like the balance, nonetheless the creators made sure to put everything that needed to be. No matter how bitter nor sweet it tasted in the end, the scales were tilted as much need be and perhaps that is one of the reasons for which it did not move me to the points the show intended it audience to. Nevertheless, once the big picture is established, I see a set of well illustrated themes. The high and lows and the clash between very early adolescence and unforgiving, brutal even unfairytaly, more like might & magic style of the world. That alone is interesting and interestingly exploited. And the final result is pleasantly, enjoyable. Also gut-wrenching and it can give you some emotional distress. This is probably why it climbed up high on community-established ranks. But it's still more like an 8/10. So why a higher result?<br><br>

    So, let's put at the forefront what's really best in this show. Phenomenal Audio. Whoever did the job, the job was done stunningly well, exemplary portrayal of the feelings, characters, the world, the progression, the everything that happens. Not only the score but also the secondary sounds and the dialogues keep up brilliantly. And considering how much of abstract contents were showcased here, I think this is a major accomplishment but how it sounded, I just purely loved it. Then, there is the already mentioned amazing world. It is truly captivating and in a way, it reminds me of how I used to play some games like Subnautica and was it, minesweeper? An old one, for sure but just the explorative features embedded, they really embellish the concealed feel of, I'd guess anyone, who'd wanted to go on an adventure and discover something new. This type of worlds, I think I've previously only came across in games and that would have been a perfect medium for Made in Abyss, also for the purpose of evoking emotions, as it contains a uniquely crafted world, objects (relicts) and rules attached to it. It's still relatively new, who knows, maybe it will come up.<br><br>

    But I guess in the end it is just the extraordinary mix, of all the things, that just simply worked and did not descend beyond a specific well-established quality line. It was truly an adventure and it has proven to be something more and even contrary to what it seemed like. Ultimately, a pretty satisfying watch and I'm up for more of the magical, uncharted and unsettling.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Bojack Horseman Season 5</h4></center>
    Bojack, Bojack, Bojack... There is something weird about me writing a review here, in which I'm giving such a high score to a series that I felt quite ambivalent towards. Because Bojack is frankly not an amazing show. It is an okay show. Pretty much as Bojack himself, I presume. A show which is supposed to be so lifelike. Filled up with depressive contents and trying to depict it in a sarcastic way. Okay Bojack, you did this (and the team it created). And there's probably also a lot of contents behind it, such as LA, life of stars and stars like Bojack. But frankly, it all just felt like a regular show that does not provide you with nothing more than... well, I don't know, there wasn't much of anything to begin with? Except for a bit fresh stylizing of characters after animals, although I felt stronger in relation to such an artistic device once I play The Wolf Among Us. I think things changed with the introduction of Season 4, which just started feeling different. The problem is, that I don't remember what was exactly happening in Season 4, except for the golden retriever jogging, which tells you already, that yeah, one of these shows that you watch and ultimately forget about. This, will not stick to Season 5, however. And I don't know who came up with the changes or maybe I just started growing up but this season actually stepped up. And let me explain why.<br><br>

    Okay, what makes a drama? Probably characters... Music, dialogues, setting... oh, there are just so many variables. But see, there is a certain pattern and a frame, for instance how long can an episode last. In terms of regular tv shows, you'd expect an episode to last 45-60 minutes, an animation around 25 minutes. See, patterns, constraints, such that usually will not allow meddling, cause how are you going to meddle? With what? You going to put out a job ad for, I don't know, a videographer who is expected to do work that nobody has seen in the industry? Then again, there are so many shows, that are not just generic by how they are but there are other elements that will just lack, like performance. Here, with Bojack, it is an animation, it's probably not easy to mess up the voiceover. What deserves your attention here however, is how this specific season was constructed. There I said it, constructed. And, this is... well, not a novum, I mean many directors will try to induce some particularly interesting changes that will make their creation stand out from the crowd. But it's also about making it... work. Now, in Bojack... now that's important. In Bojack, they managed to rebuild a standarised construct of storytelling... for each episode (as far I recall).<br><br>

    In some cases, it worked just fine. But in some cases, they managed to outdo themselves and a lot of things that I have seen so far. Let me throw in a quick spoiler: how about featuring an episode, in which you throw in the same characters, perform pretty much the same activities, feature the same theme but mash it up with 4 distinct timelines? Sounds complicated? But once you watch the episode, you will see how much the creators made it work and how coherent it remained and even that the conceptual frame and nuances all worked towards a specific theme which here felt lifelike in relation to the alter egos the portrayed characters are playing. That might, again, sound complicated. But main point being, is that they made many of such clusters work. On top of which, they upped their dialogue-related game. These were actually authentically good dialogues, even parts that should have remained stale, somehow had a quite good knack to it. But what I was in awe of, the nuances! The flood of thick and directly delivered nuances, so bluntly delivered, so extremely complicated themes delivered on a silver, bloody platter. The sarcasm worked like a charm. The jokes along. But this show is not quite just about jokes. It's about pain and suffering, and a lot of bad things that just does happen, so the unique delivery of grotesque here and really making it work is something that I could consider as in a cherry on top of a really neatly and yet uniquely crafted and presented cake. But hey! The details!<br><br>
