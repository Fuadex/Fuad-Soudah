    	As of recent, I was held up at home. Bit mindblown by a few details in life, that suddenly showed up on a constellations of electroluminescent crystals. Strong feeling of rejection popped up in my head that kept me up and a notch depressed but hey, I can't keep myself in yet another limbo, in which I'm not particularly doing a thing. One that I especially feel repulsed by.
    </p>

    <p>
    	As of late I was also thinking about how much I was thinking and how this thinking could have materialized into something constructive and how much I love doing constructive things as they usually lead to something that perhaps I might not necessarily be proud of but once it does end up at such point, I can carry on to the next and be actually quite content and just improve, advance, constructively survive and perhaps feel profoundly happy with what I've achieved, where I ended up etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    	I also think as how much of ideas I found as good in my head, eventually dissapate<br> in the oblivion of my own head

  <center><h4>Titanfall 2</h4></center>

  <p>
  	So it has been a long while since I've picked up a video game. There reasons lay everywhere. Me being primarily pre-occupied with studies in New York. As I've installed this game even before coming into New York as I planned on playing it in my free time. Freetime that really, never existed as a form while being there. I still grabbed a pad and I was a bit mad as my laptop likes to throttle a bit, which I fought with and then I figured, hey I can't play games in Sydney while it's hot but I will be in New York! Bummer. I mean, it's a good heat source while it's cold outside but ya know, you gotta work to keep yourself afloat while studying at a prominent American University. It's just how it is. Then the game stayed, surprisingly, despite I was in dire need of space on my computer. It just slipped my mind the damn thing is still there and weighs freakin' 60 GB. 60 GB! After playing the thing I don't even know what stuffs it up so much as I played the entire campaign and I still can't figure this out. It's not as huge as Grand Theft Auto V now? I heard it might be the music being in an uncompressed form and the game doing some magic with it. Aaaaand... eh... Well, in any case. Me being a bit in the middle of not doing anything prompted me to actually do something and finish the game. A wise decision, somewhat.
  </p>

  <p>
  	I gotta say, I didn't exactly know what Respawn Entertainment came up with. I just knew, that it's gonna be gud. How could I know such thing? Well, these are the guys who came up with the phenomenon of Call of Duty. Pretty much. I mean, for all of you that don't know, Call of Duty (the first one) was created by Infinity Ward. The same bunch that came up with Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. If you were to ask me at which point did the series get popular, I would probably point towards the one with number 4 in its title. But one of the reasons why people actually stormed the shops and bought the damn thing in tens of millions, was also the 2nd title. I still recall it fondly, I mean the singleplayer campaign was atmospheric and intense. Very satisfying with its still yet novel health regeneration feature. The multiplayer was yet another thing that made it a shining star, that Infinity Ward even advanced with the 4th title, shifting the universe to contemporary times, adding kill streaks, customization and many features that made it so madly playable that I wouldn't be surprised if there were still some people playing it, perhaps even on the modded maps. Then eventually came Modern Warfare 2, which I was playing with tens of friends at different times, again, extremely satisfying at multiplayer, quite very good in single too... and then at somepoint they got sacked by the publisher and snatched by EA. At first didn't seem like a very wise decision, the company came up with Titanfall 1 but it didn't seem like a hit from the start. But I guess once the right people start working together, amazing things happen and eventually they did in this case. Titanfall 2 came next with a singleplayer mode now and I'll tell you more about it, except at this point, that I liked it. The sales were apparently a bit mixed, although still went into millions, apparently Titanfall 1 performed better. But eventually, the studio came up with Apex Legends and at this point, they became one of the largest players on the market, despite there already is a crowd with PUB:G, Fortnite and others. I never looked into the game but having between 25-50 million people engaged with a game, that's impressive. It seems the studio is working on more titles and I believe they will be able to create, not just successful titles but also ones that people will remember after decades by just how good they truly are.
  </p>

  <p>
  	So what about Titanfall 2? Is it something I'll remember after years gone-by? No but yes, after reflecting on some of the first Call of Duty titles and where the founding studio ended up in. You gotta take care of your employees man. I mean, cause when they're talented and have years of experience, they start making stuff that just feels fresh. And that's a big word in an industry which relies primarily on well-worn schemes and mechanics. I guess the guys who prefered to invent and innovate and blend with mechanics that already were working well and then keep slowly pushing it forward without disregarding what was already working well, can create stuff that you may brand as purely just 'fresh'.
  </p>

  <p>
  	First of all, I'll point out the obvious of how bland the universe created is. Most of the characters you can't empathise on any level, they're just pawns on the checkboard, regardless of who they are, their position and whatnot. The game doesn't do a great job at introducing you to the game's world, what it consists of and who's who and where, despite of how it is created to contain so much, theory-wise. The game does not unwind slowly and the game is not so long itself, so I guess there was not much space for just introducing the player to anything really. The form is very call-of-dutish, with slower-paced and faster-paced parts. A bit of horrorlike parts blended in and some friendly NPCs. A variety of weapons scattered across the world that do pack a punch and are generally quite satisfying to work with. The introduction tutorial reminded me strongly of Call of Duty as you had the opportunity to try out, probably most of the weapons available in the game and see how the relatively novel navigation works, with core features: running on the walls, (double) jumbing between the walls and in general just using a very fluid movement system in which there seems to not be too much limits hooked on how you may go around the semi-sandbox environment. Throw in the mechs (titans) and all of a sudden, it's becoming a quite enjoyable experience, even if it was deprived of a plot containing the world. I mean, sure, nowadays its a standard and almost a must but if it was released about 15 or 20 years ago... nobody would've batted an eye...
  </p>

  <p>
  	But now in all this blandness that Titanfall 2 swims in, as I disclosed, the gameplay ain't bland and still there is an exception made for the relations the game builds between the player and the mech (titan), which is probably the core of why the game feels a bit more and elevated compared to its competition. There is also more to be said about the gameplay as the freshness extends and comes and goes with some extra features. Kinda spoiler alert: at some point you may shift between time as if you were playing Singularity but in a more compelling form here, some gameplay elements come together with the titan which can transport you a bit far and some weapons make the combat relatively varied. At some point you may also engage with the environment for it to serve you as a combat advantage and there are even some finishers that may be performed while you are engaged with boss fights. The creators managed to think outside the box and introduce many elements that ended up working in the game and there needs to be praise dedicated to this. Especially how, with the progression of the same, you come across new features that keep the game particularly enjoyable. The audiovisual part is for most of the time quite decent, at times it becomes really wonderful and excels especially in terms and with the game's tempo. Although I must state, it does not particularly excel as a gameform, although very enjoyable, even Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation actually put some praise towards it but it is a game that you will play and then put it aside eventually.

    <center><h4>Lion King</h4></center>

    <p>
    	I'll admit that I've gone to the cinema primarily to see the special effects. It's more like, what's the current state of VFX and how far can you push the realism? I mean, I've already known that you can go quite far about... 12 years back when I first saw Crysis and then how slow things were progressing ever since but there is some form of radical progress in terms of furry creatures. I mean, to simulate this, it would seem nobody really could get this done right, at least in terms of simulating all of it in real-time. Pre-rendered, though? Now that's a completely different pair of shoes and some managed to get the technology to such a point, that it is near-flawless. Still, such productions cost money, big-time. Lots of time too. I mean, skilled artists and animators need to be paid right, righto?
      </p>

      <p>
      	So, somehow, someone decided it's high time to recreate the Disney classic - Lion King. Probably one of the most notorious and well-kept in memories animated movie classic. I've seen it years ago and despite how it faded in my memory, I still recall the call 'Hakuna Matata!'. And so, the script didn't quite age, almost at all frankly. The characters are phenomenally crafted, lifelike, scriptwise of course. In terms of how it was animated, the animals the focus is established on most of the time is phenomenal. Although, especially at the beginning of the movie, I had some objections in relation to secondary characters, animals obviously, as to how they were animated, in a rather bit not truthful enough way. I keep saying animation, as I reckon all of these characters had to be animated. I don't imagine there was any motion capture being involved in this case? I mean, the way any production is made, nowadays, there are so many roads to accomplishing rather simple tasks, I would not be surprised if they involved people to enact some scenes with skins being applied onto them. Although, I'm curious how would they have had to play scenes, like flying or giving each other a bath by licking each other's back (yeah, there's a scene with this). I also had some reservations in relation to a few scenes that I thought were, well, not originally in the movie but you know, the constraints applied onto an adaptation do not need to be that extremely strict. And whereas at times there were right calls, a few scenes did not seem to need some editing tricks that just seemed as cheap.
      </p>

      <p>
      	All in all, it was a pleasant watch, though. Still, I felt more could have been included and it could have been perhaps a new movie of sorts, as the animation somehow keeps an upper hand in terms of how it is created in the heads of those who watch it. The more emotional parts definitely work better, exaggerated via animation techniques than VFX. It may be a thing that it requires a bit more for the industry to mature and develop people who can actually get some things done better, like in terms of mimics etc. I mean, I would have even welcomed if the movie became a little more, like, realistic realistic. In the end, the animal-world was portrayed in a way that would be okay to watch for kids as well. Except, from what I hear, it is mostly the adult kids who go to see the movie, the same adults that saw Lion King all these years ago. The good thing about the movie may be that now contemporary VFX got more light shed on it in the mainstream. Although, in the industry, there are some examples of productions that went a bit further. It's exhilirating to see how it all progresses and how it becomes simply better with each coming year but I'm waiting for something that will truly leave us all searching for our jaws launched after seeing what just may come.

  <center><h4>Walz with Bashir</h4></center>

  <p>
  	I've been hopping on and off facebook for the last couple of days. Nothing much out of the ordinary, I mean I do that a lot and kind of hate myself for doing that. Everybody lives in their own bubbles, that I've grown, learned and kept myself within the bubble, to understand that. But just the swaths of absurdity that I come across there and on the news aggregates, the way everything's put together. The way they try to tell you things and trying to tell you what you should think or feel about it. On one hand, I have a handful of sources liked and followed but not all publish things regularly. Some actually turn off their accounts or go silent, some others; just lose their edge and become rather mediocre or even sell their accounts. And then come the friends, all in all, facebook is probably the central hub for people - if you're on it, you exist. If you don't? Well, you exist too, except you fade away quicker, which also bothers me. And then there are the advertisements. As of late - tons and no way to really dodge these with uBlock origin. I mean, I kind of start wondering how would websites look like without the ad blocker, I mean this keeps again myself in an even tighter bubble. But then it's wide enough to capture what my friends like and comment on and... eh.. maybe I should open up a new accounts with a filter bubble of its own, one that I will keep myself to and get rid of all the stuff that is out there?
  </p>

  <p>
  	Bit off-topic there but there is a reason behind it. As I discovered this pearl by hopping on and off facebook, it's for the times like this, when I start to value the time I'm putting to waste. And I am squandering time like mad, way too much time. The time I should put towards, I don't know, breathing fresh air, as fresh it gets around where I am now where I will be not in coming weeks. I mean, exceptions are made and I am guilty of committing too many. Some of them turn into gold and so, a friend of mine liked something on facebook that drew my attention real quick. I drilled into this, I liked a new facebook page. And then scrolled down, further down discovering more amazing content and a trailer to this movie, which reminded me very heavily of those really good war productions. There is something about these war-oriented productions, which aim for hyper-naturalism of sorts. And perform extremely well in conveying the depth and breadth of what they're depicting. And what they're depicting is war, in its raw form. Deprived of heroism or maybe with mix-ins of those. After all, we get stories and those stories, some of them being told right here. They get brightened up, coloured. But you don't often get in movies confused soldiers, depraved and demoralised chains of command. Although, told in such universal way that you could fit in many war stories and situate it in, probably the most fruitful grounds: Vietnam. But still, as it is situated from the, I'd describe as unfiltered Jewish perspective, it's a watch that provides the audience with a rather raw depiction of how the conflicts there truly look like.

  	There's a lot of great elements that come into one. Perhaps the animations feel a little brittle and stiff but the aesthetical form, the artistic approach towards employing the thick, full-bodied animation style does its job exemplarily. It really helps build an emotional connection with the viewer. Even the juggling between the micronarratives, as there are many told in the process of carrying out the fuller perspective of the protagonist who lost his memory, actually all are told in a very compelling and non-confusing way. They all provide a decent glimpse into how the population lives and lived, the contemporary and past of the young country of Israel. How do the relations within the society work in conjunction with the military service. There are links deeper into the past and correlations made. This entire movie actually spreads out its net over all corners of the Jewish society and nation. The writing here really helps and the screenplay advances rather logically. I very much liked seeing the complexities of war depicted in absolutely staggering style and how shades of grey enthralled all of it. The movie also headed some direction, closer to the end it started shifting its style a bit, serving a purpose of delivering a shocking blow. It succeeded in doing so, although I feel that perhaps the universalism of the horrors of war was a bit lost in all this, leaving the movie with a bit of a journey that was scattered and yet so surreal at times and totally valid in what it portrayed.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
