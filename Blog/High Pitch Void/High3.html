    <center><h4>Wandering Inspiration?</h4></center>
    There is the thing that drives you in life. It can be anything. Anyone. Especially someone in fact. Although in many cases it could reach beyond and favour something especially. Something that will keep you going in life, keep you interested and willing to continue living as it keeps being inspiring. I feel these may be very controversial words to be said but I'm sure anyone can recall at least one thing in life that made them more alive for days at least? Was it any particular music album that you have listened to? A recent cup of coffee you have discovered? Majestic landscapes that you managed to reach long distances over with your eyes after taking a long scenic hike? Perhaps a video game that made you commit to decisions refracting back? Or maybe a good book that made you dwell for longer as you considerably taken into account what it harboured within? Now, you see, I feel like I have been through all, except one medium I have not truly really pierced through - books, with hard cover, audible or electronic all alike.<br><br>

  </div><br>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>So, what am I waiting for?</h4></center>
    I guess it all come down to the way I way raised. It's not that I do not read books just because this is what I vowed for early in years. In fact, I actually do read quite a substantial amount of material daily, especially on the internet. Most of which I would consider being far from quality, more like jabbing and trash thrown around with some elements of gold, ruby and especially magnificent elements out there being fetched around. Along with all the major and not so much, companies, crying out for you attention and money directed towards them and the middle-man such as facebook, siphoning even more of your time daily. But in return for quite fair goods, I mean communication right?<br><br>

    The thing was, I was never quite taught that books could be fun to read. Playing video games, on the other hand, was something that I explored from my early days. Curious, even despite I was absolutely bad and interpreting what was happening. I mean, give a Deus Ex to a 6-year old and all I could do, was skip the training session and walk for maybe 150 meters through the first level. Getting killed, although having absolutely no idea what for, what is going on, why and everything. But I suspect, at the time, it was the explorative feature which really bound to my attention. Then there were cartoons, hell these are made to be fun. Although, if you think about them - violent too, many with violance taken to extremes, as cartoons often do. Just recall cat and the mouse cartoon. But then, I was also introduced to some books made for kids such as Dr. Seuss's series, which in fact were quite fun, entertaining, teaching something in the process, in fact very educational but doing it the right way. Then movies blended in at some point once I got to Poland, mostly sensational ones, although I guess you can't translate like that, let's call suspense movies (that just might be the name). Well, these were fun to watch. A lot happening, explosions, guns blazing, dynamism. And me, not quite following the plot as I was to unaware of anything really happening on the screen except for the stellar symphony of chaos, just as one happening in real life that would fuck everything up, I would have found just as entertaining. Adults would walk away at some point but why would a child? Even in chaos, some sort of a rhythm and tempo are present? Then there was music. Too, dynamic and a lot happening. Primarily nu metal. And I guess at some point I managed to read into a story from the Witcher saga... which was fun to read. Which was a major discovery for me, as the setbooks I had to deal with in school, were just boring as the tenth year having to wake up in the very same bedroom.<br><br>

    So where am I going with this, you may ask?<br>
    Good question, let me hold you hand for a little while longer.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Gimme Depth</h4></center>
    So there's the thing. There always needs to be some sort of a point in providing education. If the frame is constructed badly and you see no point in pursuing it then why do it at all? Back in Sydney, I wasn't quite back in my, what, first grade was it? Then I came to Poland and somewhat I continued a fairly bad-average grade life, primarily I mean. Books? They just bored me. And perhaps I had a point. I probably even had one. And with years passing by I guess it was just my body and mind, which upon flipping a cover would automatically scream for hybernation, oh well, sleep that is. Or maybe it is a standard reaction to just reading anything. But I don't feel the same when entering even substantially more extensive, quality materials available on the web. Which is just simply strange to say the least.<br><br>

    Let's put it another way. If I have a clean sheet, I could probably write till the end of days. Like I'm doing now in sublime. I mean it has numbers of rows that I'm writing into. It even has a geniusly conceived visualisation of highly condensed material that I was working on. But I don't feel tired by doing this. I keep just on doing my thing, because I have no idea how much I have produced, in contary to what I would get with Microsoft Word. Eventually that can span out to a bloody 10k document but I won't know this. Until I actually try to measure it all. With books, it just may be similar and hence extensive materials on websites. But you can get into anything I guess. I mean, TV Shows can bore one too. This was something I got magnetised into, after video games died down a notch and it was becoming slowly huge, so I managed to pick up on the all major shows in time. Movies kind of kept on going simuntaneously, they always do, they're movies so they're constructed as a one-time thing and discarded usually, as unfortunate this may sound. And then, there are books that almost never got through me. Which is something that I truly regret, as doesn't matter how much I would pierce through a great variety of media. Some of them, I did not discover too much either, like comics or manga (although I did a bit of Anime). But books, there is just so much in them and many media are based on this particular one. Many media will not make you elicit emotions as profoundly as books would. Making you weep, or happy. Take you on a carousel of emotions. But I guess what I am particularly looking for, are three things. Material, content and depth as one. Two, frames for elicitng emotions. Three, base that will complement my knowledge of language with which I could operate better in everyday life. And knowing how critical I can be in relation to any created media, I think that books could just fit the holes in me. Just with one caveat that I see, as the language I read, usually gets inscribed in me and I do remember what I read. This influences me, whether I like it or not. And that is probably one of the failsafes I had established throughout the years. Hence I usually need subtitles in movies.<br><br>

    <center><h4>...and then</h4></center>
    So, what did I come to mention here, eh? Oh, well I started listening to 1984. Yaaay, finally, slowly finishing my 3-4 dystopian classics. I did read Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Hell, it was decent but I'm a harsh little fella and gave it a 6/10, primarily for featuring a highly contained world and parts that were quite difficult to follow. Also the ending was a bit of a let-down. But particular parts in this vision were delivered with such grace that I just would have given a 9.5/10 for those if I could. Some of the clashes of personalities featured were mesmerising. The details depicted in key moments just beautifully destructive. And these are the parts that I guess I kind of live on to see and study.<br><br>

    So I still have Huxley's Brave New World to finish. A book that I can't say really lives up to its fame. Especially, that it is written in a very average style, with many difficult words inscribed without much need for them, world-building introduced to such a grandeous scale, that it took around 20 pages at first and lead really to nothing. Main characters being bland, although it just might have been the point but to the point, that I just would really consider it a flaw. And the main plot revolving around... oh well, trivial stuff really. And some unprobable reactions introduced by the main characters, just unlikely to have happened. Some details were really good, though, along with some powerful quotes. But that was just about it. 5/10<br><br>

    Mr. Orwell! Oh, well. I started you off with Animal Farm and that was an indeed good decision to do, as the writing style was just marvelous for the first pages. That was exactly what I was looking for in terms of world-building that Huxley has never proven to deliver. And the myriad of references to totalitarian systems delivered in such greatly concise manner. It was good. Although began getting relatively standard along the way. 8/10<br><br>

    1984, a book that is somewhat becoming an urban legend. Had quite high hopes for this. But in the end, for the first chapters, it let me down a bit, as it concentrated on the depicted world by Orwell. A world that I could call concise, something that you cou definitely picture. With depth, although constrained and deprived of features, which became fixed later on. It's just, the features were quite bland again but here in comparison to Huxley, I actually felt this was done on purpose and well, as some characters started eventually popping up and were even interesting to read into. I would consider the world presented, as quite fictional, I disagree with people providing links to the real world and the book, after having experienced the book. But what I see is a great deal of connotations that one can establish not any totalitarian system, in fact most that were established in human world and some to the contemporary times. The details are plentiful, quality, far-reaching and supported by some really good quotes too. Although some of the key ones, I would not consider too good.<br><br>

    <center><h4>...bout movies now?</h4></center>
    Oh well but you can't rely completely on book now! Can you? And so I took a trip to Campbelltown, craving a few things: a quality HSP, a movie and eventually even a good cup of coffee. I got everything. King's Kebab is the king in terms of HSPs and they can make one after which you won't even twitch, it's like the quality quality of HSPs, never a better kebab existing in your life. Then, the movie, which for some reason I thought would cost 12.5$. Now, bear with me, normally movies in Aus will cost around 20$. But I found this place, called Dumaresq cinema, which I figured, you know what? I'll check out some local joints. Not only do they sell tickets for 7.5$ but they also sell drinks and popcorn for so dirt-cheap that it's just ridiculous. I mean, 3$ for a large pepsimax? Are you serious? They getting government help or something? And then there is the coffee which I came across very... surprisingly, out of the blue just blazed through my eyes, I was like, wait a minute... Is that.. Is that a coffee place that actually looks like a proper coffee place? So I investigated and what I discovered was this. Great interior design, with a nice graffiti painted on the wall. Quite some plants featured inside. Nicely decorated bar, interesting selection of foods and coffee was what I was interested in. Perhaps the cups could use a better design as it leaked but the coffee, was good! Hazelnut and citrus later on. Just what I would consider a nice taste palette embedded.<br><br>

    And so, the movie I have seen is Mission Impossible: Fallout. I, can't really review this really to my greatest extent. I'll try: The movie began wonderfully. It was quite speeding, parts I did not quite get but I really liked the pacing, setting and especially the cinematography that continued for around half an hour! A marvel to see, with the lightning design just stunningly wonderful and takes that kept up really fantastically. Martial arts from a person who doesn't know anything about those, felt natural in my eyes and entertaining to watch. What I felt a bit let down, was that the story did not quite match up, in a sense that what I saw, felt at times a bit inscrutable. In a sense, that what happened, should have no happened, as it made no sense whatsoever. At times, the plot got chaotic but it remained concise and quite well presented, delivered, nicely written. Although, some dialogues felt cliche and, oh well, mission impossible-cliche, also a little bit trivial and too easygoing and trivial. A bit too standarised, especially some acts. But these are just needles in a quality haystack. Overall, it was a splendid feature, that even felt unknown as to how it would really end. Some CGI felt uncanny but most was very well executed. The movie reached somewhat the level of 9/10 but it remains at 8/10, as eventually the movie dropped the magnificent, beyond standard lightning design and continued a solid watch.<br><br>

    I have also finished another thing, a TV Show, just 3rd season of The Expanse. And that was actually a partial let-down. Especially the first half of the season, which was pierced through with bad dialogues, polarised and flattened main acts that uncovered flaws in acting, at times really bad CGI, extremely uncanny turns in psychological profiles of the characters, unnecessary plot drives. It was just very average... Considering what the first two season delivered, I was very surprised to see how bad this actually got. And then, everything sort of changes with the second part, which manage to uplift itself very nicely, back to the quality of the previous two seasons but somehow as if still with some flaws attached, such as somewhat unnecessary second acts. I'll give it a 7/10 but I expected significantly more after this show as it was just that good in its previous seasons.<br><br>
