    	Oh my. I have seen so much. I have played so much. And I haven't done so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thing is, the more I live life, the more it recurrently reminds me of being, living in a loop. I get to do some work and stuff for some time, even very ferociously and meticulously. And then it all goes away and I can't get a grip on whatever my life seems to be like.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if I have plans to do stuff with it and be productive and everything, it all eventually dials down to... well... maybe this and that and nothing and a bit more...
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess what I'm trying to say is that I have too much time at hand and when that really does happen, I mean, nothing happens, so to fill up the void in life, I'll go and try grasp as much of anything that comes to my mind even if it turns to be a blanc space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you begin thinking, again, whether you should, if you get a chance to actually think.

	  <center><h4>Let's do this one a bit differently - Studio Ghibli</h4></center>

  <p>
So, covid happened, lockdowns, needing to stay at home and I also threw a diet on top of all this.</p>


<p>So what can you do with all this time? Well, I had lots of different plans and what I also threw below all this, is a leave of absense from studying, so all this free time flooded my lifetime.
</p>

<p>
Instead of solely focusing on what I should really be focusing, which is getting more practice with sets of software that I still have my edu licences for, after being quite substantially active, pro-active and productive for about a month, eventually, steadily, I slid off towards consuming instead of producing culture.
</p>
<p>
It's not that I put it off altogether. It's not going away for good yet. But I felt I needed also a bit of time for myself and to think and these two go hand in hand, except when you have nothing but free time at hand.
</p>
<p>
But here I wanted to drive a monologue on what I focused on eventually.
</p>
<p>
So, as I recurrently felt as if I was lacking behind culture-wise, in terms of what I've experienced from the gamut of movies, shows, video games and books, I gradually began sunking into one of each interchangably, having in mind memories of friends mentioning at particular points in time as they'd digest 4-5 movies a day and so. Example that can translate to any one of the other.
</p>
<p>
At first, I decided to take a closer look at what in fact I have really consumed by far. So on different days I'd scan through my account on goodreads and filmweb. Goodreads I don't have to introduce, filmweb yet is a polish equivalent of imdb, which feels far superior, especially since heaps of my childhood friends use it and it automatically looks up folks I have on facebook.
</p>
<p>
So I did a thorough scan of video games I've played... Movies and Shows I've watched... Books I've read... And in the process, I've fished out stuff that I was very interested in digging into.
</p>
<p>
Now in case of books, it's almost embarrasing how little I've read in my life and how many classics I've skipped during my school years. Especially since one of the first things to frustrate me in a movie/show/game is often narrative-related and I get fed up and triggered just way to often, especially in case of video games.
</p>
<p>
But from all this frustration, I kept failing to see that what is pure narration, are in fact books themselves. And despite that I read lots online, it's still nothing compared to what I could potentially if I just picked the right book or two. Perhaps I'm not the only one to blame, finding books usually a tedious chore coming from school. Or perhaps the school system in Poland is designed in a way, that even good books lose all their glory in the eyes of its pupil-audience. Or just teachers consistently failed at engaging their students and creating ravishing interest for books. Or perhaps I could've used a pair of glasses to help me focus back in the day.

	  <center><h4>Other Animation</h4></center>

  <p>
In the end, it turned out I'm not that much of an illiterate as I once thought. But I could do much better and I got through some, well, audiobooks instead, as I felt these to be more suiting to me. Some were great, some lacked in ways, in some despite not appealing to me greatly, I still found value. By far I marked off 16 books this year, some of them quite big titles going on for about 20 hours. I'll probably hold on with recommendations 'till I get through more.</p>

<p>
In the end, I took a break with audiobooks as well, as I had to RMA my IEMs back to the states (which took about a month). Turns out, that I have a problem with focusing not only with my eyes on books but also when there's background noise and I listen to audiobooks. And only with my noise isolating -35-42 dB IEMs do I feel like I can actually focus on audiobooks.
</p>
<p>
And then there's another bullshit with the contact-tracing app, which kept disturbing my bluetooth amp. Would've helped if phone producers kept their minijacks in smartphones but nooo, too much space eh. Uninstalling the app fixed the issue.
</p>
<p>
Let's take movies and shows on now.
</p>
<p>
As part of the scanning process, I started to think about what sort of animations I've seen in life and old shows and movies, as I'd see lots of stuff but today I'd remember all this in scratches and shreds. The shows were easier to figure out but movies were a fickle and these I'm still working my way through.
</p>
<p>
I did eventually take a closer look at animation, though. Grew fascinated as part of my studies this year. And as I sometimes have this weird tendency, that I will get into something without really being the expert in (which often, if I'm seeking education, this should be fine).
</p>
<p>
...and then all hell broke loose.
</p>
<p>
I binged through most of Ghibli movies on Netflix earlier this year and finally understood, from a different perspective, just why they're such a great studio. Except, the general perception is likely that they're sweet and children-friendly but after seeing most of their stuff, this is not main, driving and even dominant quality often. Instead, I'd find often very richly and carefully crafted work with top of the game outstanding attention to detail work, that pertained all across: the quality of animation, worldbuilding, character characterisation, story deeply imbued with references to history, religion, environment, some of which would carry exceptional emotional resonance and some would dazzle with novel animation techniques. Pure craftsmanship. And even if some movies did not blow me away, I'd still see the exceptional craftsmanship that never got lost in any of Ghibli productions.
</p>
<p>
Of course, not all of their stuff, even if it was said it was on Netflix, in the end it wasn't. I'll get back to this, though.
</p>
<p>
Then there was the other sort, of short movies. As I suddenly discovered, that there's quite a crowd of those out there. Most of which are... just ok. Kind of surprised me in ways, as I just know how much effort it takes for entire teams to create even a few minutes long short. But among the sea of this stuff, I'd come across some real gems. And I'd also notice some places, which were responsible for those gems, like Filmakademie in Baden Württemberg. And that opened my eyes a bit in terms of some concepts that I've seen elsewhere but were released much earlier. And also just how much technical progress occurred in the last 20 years and more then other things hitting my head.

  <center><h4>TV Animation</h4></center>

  <p>
Eventually I got through a bit too many shorts.
</p>
<p>
So I got back to movies with Netflix and Amazon Prime at the helm. And those streaming services, I swear - where do I begin.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I shouldn't, as there's just too much shit to throw at each. One specialising in producing shit and advertising as original golden shit and the other deciding to list movies and shows for rent all of a sudden, as if to justify the lack of stuff to offer as part of their subscription platform. Not to mention the dramatic drop in quality of most of what they release and focusing on amount of stuff being pushed out instead of quality.
</p>
<p>
But in the end it all comes down to the problem that Netflix and other streaming services turned into regular cable tv. I walked from tv, because it didn't offer much of a choice. But the more I look at (ex.) netflix the more I feel it doesn't offer much of a choice either. I'm being flashed with lots of covers as if for netflix to demonstrate that there's lots to watch but in case of what really might interest me there isn't much.
</p>
<p>
And they threw away lots of tools to get people interested as well. There used to be a grading system and they swapped that 'match rate'. At least prime still shows imdb score for a selection of shows! And they really came down hard on vpners, to the point, that they don't even care about their native subscribers - which aligns with my regular cable tv argument. Oh, hey, you're in germany? Would you like to watch some anime? Sure mate but only with german subtitles. It got to the point they don't even show the name of the show but only the cover. Oh, you're in korea and the show's name on the cover is in korean? Well, fuck you, fuck you and your subtitles too. This is just plainly anti-consummer behaviour. Say I'm an exchange student somewhere. Suddenly my subscription is unusuable for most of the offered content. And honestly, I'd be surprised if subscribers in non-english speaking countries are fine with this as well. Say, you want to learn english but all you're offered are subtitled and even dub only in your language. That's just feels wrong, innit?
</p>
<p>
So perhaps I'm part of the problem as I use a vpn to access shows overseas. It used to be better, I could even connect on my phone. Now it would seem vpn providers have to do all sorts of backend black magic to have those services useable and they're not running in all locations anymore.
</p>
<p>
And in the end, some locations that do not offer subtitles for non-netflix originals, still somehow pop up. For instance, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex had eng subs for 1st season but not for the 2nd. And then when I came back and check, it had for its 2nd season as well. Sometimes I'm out of luck.
</p>
<p>
But in the end, I kind of end up just scouring through out of curiosity as to what's available overseas. And interesting realisations come up. For instance, in South Korea they have a great selection of Disney movies. In Germany they have lots of really great anime. In the US, they have some animations not to be found anywhere else that are distributed by one very particular, specialising in anime company in new york - G Kids. In Canada they just had a huge collection of Charlie Chaplin movies. Indian netflix is surprisingly powerful. And there are titles, like on Japanese netflix that draw my attention like crazy and then I discover, that, well I can't watch them but they actually do seem in fact very freakin' interesting - and ultimately end up on my to-watch list. Some take me by ultimate surprise and that's when I get the most happy, for some weird reason.

<center><h4>Regular Shows</h4></center>

    <p>
And then there's Amazon Prime, which has a great selection in America. Some cool stuff in Canada but they changed something and I can't watch anything anymore. A very impressive collection which shifts constantly in Great Britain. I got especially impressed with their Anime collection. And then one day I discovered one more streaming service that is free of charge called Tubi, in which I found some really great, old movies, anime-wise as an example: anime original of Alita - Gunnm or Kite.
</p>
<p>
From all of this in the end I shifted decisevely into the Anime realm, though, as I feel like I hit some gold. This genre can be seen as quite infantile, childish and all of the sort which I feel is generally actually true but to generalise an entire medium feels very unfair. In any case, something that carries on from the subscription services problem realm, is the general feel of lack of curation. If you've never been introduced properly to a specific medium, how can you discover the good stuff on your own?
</p>
<p>
Well, you can but it can take a while for you to sink in. And then one day I rediscover this small polish cable tv block - Hyper+, which specialised in video games but had an anime block. And today, looking at the list, I can't say anything short of being impressed enough with the selection they offered.
</p>
<p>
But I've still got some of the stuff on my list to watch so I'll withstand from saying anything else.
</p>
<p>
Another interesting thing is, how you consume all this.
For instance, I watched Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and one of the things that impressed me the most wats the soundtrack. To the point that I just simply fell in love with in and decided to look into what else the composer composed for. And then I discovered just how fucking amazing this composer is (Yoko Kanno). And it drew my attention to the next animes that I want to watch, primarily due to the soundtrack but also due to what value the shows she composed for carried out with and just how unique those shows were.
But the music is just simply nothing short of being beautiful. Not to mention, that the composer utilises an entire spectrum of styles which boggles my mind enough but the mixing is nothing short of amazing and on my headphones R70x, being able to just discern all the instrument, playing where and when and how and just how all this combines with what I was watching… wow…
And in case of what I am watching. Just recently I got myself a new monitor, targeted towards color-critical work. But I did not exactly understand the significance of all the colour spectrums and so on. Just once I got the monitor that I eventually settled on and put Display P3 on… despite it apparently not being all perfect, jesus… I could swear that I haven’t seen such reds in my life… and the extensions of green and blue, which adobergb covers are also quite amazing but the other direction of reds and purples… it feels as if I never really watched anything properly in my life.

  <center><h4>Movies and Books</h4></center>

<p>
1000 Movies! Pt. 2
</p>
  <p>
So many.
What does it mean?
What can I derive from it?
</p>
<p>
Well, bits of nothing and bits of everything so to speak.
</p>
<p>
I was making subtle attempts at catching up with the world, as there are certain media formats that I simply feel as if I fell far behind compared to everyone when I account my age and this day and age.
</p>
<p>
In order to figure this out, though, counter-intuitively to last.fm, which automatically scrobbles everything I've listened to on whatever streaming service or app there may be, I had to manually sort all this out on a website dedicated to sorting this out.
</p>
<p>
But while accounting music seemed like an easy feat, as I could very easily backtrack what I listened to when I was <13 years old, the very same thing does not carry across for everything else: books, movies, shows, video games and everything. Fuck if I know what I kept my eyes peeled at at the age of 8, 10 or 12, especially if it was cable TV and especially when all the movies I watched were heavily localised in Polish. All I know, I've watched tons.
</p>
<p>
So with a bit more time at hand, I made strides to see how far behind I was in case of: movies, tv shows and video games on a Polish equivalent of imdb.
</p>
<p>
And in the end it turned out that... I'm not so much of an illiterate as I deemed myself at first.
</p>
<p>
In fact, it's quite crazy to think that it's been 1000 movies, about 240 tv shows and about 340 video games. Especially, that I haven't been playing much in my last couple of years and I didn't keep a big tempo with the rest, well, until very recently.
</p>
<p>
But I wonder a bit whether this all counts and what does it count for.
</p>
<p>
In case of movies, it's bit deceptive. In theory I've almost doubled the amount of movies I've seen this year compared to the rest of my entire life. How? By bingeing through short movies. Should these count? What about animated shorts?
</p>
<p>
Who's to say a 6-minute long short has that much of a lesser value compared to a 3-hour long feature? What about a 200-pages long book compared to a 20-pages long one? Or a TV show with over 200 episodes compared to one of just merely 5? Have I really watched a show if I missed out on a season or two?
</p>
<p>
As I began an educational journey into the world of CG and animation and working in a studio-setting alongside many crazily-talented artists towards an animated short, I kind of realised that I haven't actually really seen that much of animation in last decade or many shorts for that matter.
</p>
<p>
And as I usually, very counter-intuitively do in life, taking a bite at something without having really that much knowledge or experience beforehand and then frantically doing all possible to get up to speed, I decided to do just as much as that.
</p>
<p>
And the appetite continuously grew as I ate. Rolling through all the Ghibli movies, old Disney features, Disney and Pixar animated shorts, other school animated shorts, very old animated shorts and old Polish animated shorts. My list kept growing, as I worked my way through all of it, I kept finding titles which for a variety of reasons kept launching me to the moon.
</p>
<p>
And I could probably list off an entire series of recommendations with all the reasons for why it's worth consuming and what I saw in all this but... in the end there's just so much. And the list of what I deem fit to see does not seem to cease.
</p>
<p>
...and then there's the matter of what's next.
</p>
<p>
Well, I could probably just launch Netflix for that matter. But my frustration with this service is just ever-growing, which seems to provide a neverending selection to choose from but under the hood, it's just become another cable TV.

  <center><h4>Kick-Ass 2</h4></center>

  <p>
Man, I don't even know if I should cover this one. Every now and then you end up watching a movie that, I mean, there's nothing bad about watching it. Except that it doesn't necessarily need a review. Here we have Kick-Ass, sequel of it. I mean the original was kinda fun to watch, concentrating on someone who decided to become a superhero, cause why not. The sequel kinda, well, continues this. And it extends in some ways but overall feels a bit trite and lacking, well, much in everything. But, you know, it's enjoyable so I'll just leave it at that.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
