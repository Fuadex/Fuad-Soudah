    <center><h4>The Outer Worlds</h4></center>

    <p>
The were a couple of things I was fondly awaiting, coming closer till the end of this year. Obsidian Entertainment is one of those studios that, whatever they do and gets released, it gotta be good. So how hyped can one get once they hear they're doing a videogame that looks pretty much like Fallout but without Fallout in its name. See, these are the guys that did Fallout: New Vegas. A Fallout game that made its, sort of predecessor Fallout 3, look like a bit of a kid compared to its older, muscular and more aware brother. While Fallout 3 had some bold, powerful and successfully executed ideas such as the start of the game where you saw yourself being raised in a vault, then the light shock of going outside to the wasteland and I'd also throw in the idea of nuketown into the mix with a few more interesting aspects about the wasteland world and the wrap-up of the game (now that I look at what I wrote, it's actually quite a bit), Fallout: New Vegas was a much more refined product from its very start 'till finish. The way how your personality, perks and whatnot are assessed from the very beginning. How your story slowly unravels and how you discover the world bit by bit. How each of the world's factions you come across have refined backstories with ideologies embedded and encompassing nature. How your choices in fact felt as if they really weighed and mattered and impacted the depicted world with what you'd do, would directly blowback on how the world looked like. Amazing personalities and dialogue lines, fascinating developments and twists, it just felt like a fully fledged RPG game, that Fallout 3 could not really reach as it felt like Oblivion with Guns. There were some shortcomings and the atmosphere could have felt as somewhat more westerny than wastelandy looking but nonetheless I still remind of it quite rather fondly.
      </p>

      <p>
      	The outer worlds is somewhat a baby of the same studio and I think this studio also had some input in the earlier fallout games and classic RPGs as well. So, hopes were high. And these started to get a bit whoopy once I discovered, the game would tear and not run well on my PC for some weird reason. So... first of all, how come this kind of a game can run so badly, it doesn't even look like 2019, it still looks and behaves more like 2009. It's been almost a decade, why do you need more powerful computers to run a game that could've run on computers from a decade ago? The one I had, 4 years old, would not run it well anymore (GTX970) but my laptop (GTX1060), actually would. Or perhaps it's a matter of some other things... (HDD/SSD?). Nevermind.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Once I got this to run properly I would start to discover many good things about this game. The first world you land in looks... fascinating. There is so much new around here. And so much of this looks just so... beautiful. From the very get go you get to start using so of the abilities you craft at the beginning of the game. And to be fair, the RPG capabilities and its backend system is actually quite gracefully refined. You get a fair bit of XP from combat but also from completing quests. And you can talk to NPCs and get a chance of using special dialogue lines if you've got sufficient skills to activate them. At first it feels a bit complicated but it works really well once you get your head wrapped around it. Still, a little bit later in the game it seems as if all you get to change is really cosmetics, so the slight pressure of getting more XP and completing side quests remains valid for most of the game, until the very end which is a whole lot different story. Which on its own, is a fairly long story. And in theory there is lots of ways of going around it and completing it, which feels nice at least for a good part of the game.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Let's continue about the positives. The story actually takes off quite nicely and bombards the audience with a very kind depth. First encounter - corporationism, probably some of the worst of its kind. Then, you get to later experience others, some that pivoted more towards nature. More towards anarchy, more towards social reforms, pirates, outlaws etc. Basically the game will take you through all the social order the game is constructed of and showcase some of its extremes to its audience. A couple of times in my life I fantasized about creating a game of my own in which I would put different factions which would represent different socio-political ideologies. And it would seem that someone just went ahead and did just that. A corporation that cuts corners on every single thing, including their workers' wellbeing, where people don't know what weekend is and have to rent their own grave out in case they die? A settlement of wealthy people, where beaurocrasy chases its own tail, where people don't really work and complain how hard life is? You get much more and a pretty phenomenal spectrum of socio-political ideologies in extremes showcased in action, put together to certain extents that the writing even put me into awe. But there are problems in it.
      </p>

      <p>
      	First of all, the world doesn't quite change accordingly to the player's actions. I felt the same way in some cases pertaining to The Witcher 3, where I felt it almost threw me out of immersion to due this. But here, it doesn't even budge where and when it really should. Which kind of weighs off the immersion, cause for a role playing game, where your actions should impact the world, you don't exactly see this happening. This also is the same case when you clear some roads and hostiles respawn there, which feels a bit annoying at best. Then, there is the case of, especially, friendly NPCs. You get to put together a team of companions and... they all feel a bit random and lacking personality. More a bit like a bunch of youtubers, you kind of get to perhaps like some but not too much overall. They sometimes will engage in conversations you make across with other NPCs... but some stuff pertaining to their own lifelihood, where they will evoke strong opinions, afterwards if you try engaging them again, they won't really... say much at all. It all feels a bit contradictory the further you advance with the storyline. And it's a bit a shame, as this game had some good material but it all falls bland a bit. And then you start thinking...
      </p>

      <p>
      	...that it all was already here before in some ways. This entire ship thing, with an AI-built into it and companions. THIS IS MASS EFFECT! Except, they did a better job in Mass Effect, as after each main quest, you could engage in conversations with your crew members and they would actually respond in some even harsh ways to what you have done. They had better writing, although it was also a bit more straightforward in terms of how it all functioned but it did and well. It doesn't end there, though. There is kind of an equivalent of nuketown in this game once you advance later. There is literally a rip-off from The Walking Dead: The Game. Many ideas in this game freakin' come from other games and I'm not the one to judge whether 'borrowing' ideas from other games is bad, especially that they did it okay, in their own ways but... It feels unsavoury, the frequency of this and it impacts a whole lot of another thing - the quests are far from getting a surprising outcome. You can foresee much of what really happens in this game and that sort of ruins again, the immersion. You also get all those grand stories about how difficult some things are and then you run guns blazing and there is not that much of an effort done on your end. Also, the dialogue system is exactly like Fallout and the world looks a bit like Fallout.
      </p>

<p>
      This game is literally a cross of many games and I still actually liked it. The combat system was nice, the entire system was nice. But I could not help but notice that this game was somehow, as if, left unfinished. Perhaps severed in half? There are planets in the system that you do not end up exploring at all. There are storylines that were developed but were never really pursued in the end. Again, this thing with engaging in heated discussions with some characters in-game and the situation not impacting some other characters or the world altogether. It's as if the first part of the game got the most refining and then the latter started getting some... I don't know, becoming a nightmare of sorts to stitch everything together? Some locations are as-if clones and, I have to say this again, when this game was just about to start getting its momentum... Oh no! It just ended!

	  <center><h4>Mr. Robot Season 3</h4></center>

  <p>
Well, that was one strange ride. It's hard to classify this as hard or even strange actually. This was one good ride. Although, I wish I kept going ever since I have began this season. So, it kicks off quite primely, for people who were not acquainted with Mr Robot, the start serves everything on a plate in a rather convenient and unobtrusive manner. This, actually, I believe becomes a notch of a problem with this show. The problem being, that too much is actually revealed too early. It's an interesting creative take on the show, kind of depriving it of twists. And concentrating rather on the suspense, which in a way should degrade the show in my eyes but it does so in a quite stylish and nuanced way. The good thing is, that the show's creators do not cut short on their creative excesses, pouring interesting direction and scenography into the mix, imbuing it with some rather unconventional writing. The long takes are at times near paranormal. I have seen a share in my life but what they're doing here and how they're outperforming is astonishing. It really deserves some praise for how the show is being driven because it rolls quite fashionably so to speak. The attention to detail, juggling with styles, overall polish. Yeah, Mr. Robot shows off again as a solid watch that rattles some boundaries, but!
  </p>

  <p>
  	I had a bit of a problem following this season overall. First episodes, yeah pretty solid. And then it remains solid actually but somewhat, somehow I had real trouble following its advances. On one hand, I think its the show's dynamism that I lay blame on. There is just so much happening, which on its own is not really a bad thing. But from all this high performance bonanza nothing much jumps out for me to remember for years to come. It's a very weird feeling, cause as much as I would love to send praises and love for the show, I just can't, because it didn't really surprise me as much. Well, perhaps for the wrapping episode and the bottle episode, in terms of how detached the writing started to get but it all was somewhat made ok, cause in the end, the fitchery, beautiful way of keeping the conventions (un!) going, it remained a pleasant watch overall. Which is a bit scary. Put some bit nicer scenography and dialogues and all of a sudden, you don't have much problems dealing with stuff that just does not excel but is overall good.
  </p>

  <p>
  	I had a bit of a problem with the way this show was leading its storyline as well. The jumping between scenes made it lose its grit a bit. Sometimes the same feels with Elliot's personalities. It's a bit confusing at times to figure out exactly what's what. At times I also felt, that the dialogues didn't really actually get too great either. It's as if there was a bit of dissonance between what was being performed and what was being written. Perhaps that's what you would say an unconventional conventional show would be like. I don't know. Hard to say. It was good. In fact phenomenal for much of its time but somewhat somehow kind of brought it all down a massive notch. And that I can't pinpoint exactly what was the cause, actually is a bit scary.
  </p>

  <p><center>8/10</center></p>

  <center><h4>Mr. Robot Season 4</h4></center>

  <p>
  	It flows hyper, continues the great direction from S3 and goes nuts with the format with each episode, which in turn makes me hyper. The finish is bland but I'm willing to turn a blind eye since most of the season was exceptionally good.
  </p>

  <p>
  	...what? I'm lazy. It's been a season, as if, the executives figured they were constrained by something, so they decided to do some crazy stuff within their reach. They played around with the format non-stop, which felt in its own way exceptional. Going all the way through thriller, horror, family-grade production and etc. Everything kind of changes and it's wonderful to experience this, it's as if the production went towards showcasing the wide array of performances the actors and actresses are able to carry out and of course the production skills. All probably took quite some strain but the final effect is mind-boggling. I'm not a fan of how the show ended but it had some real, elevated and phenomenal moments and some conclusions were really mind-grappling and terrific to follow. Cause of the final, I'm gonna lean towards an 8/10 but the show accounts for some really high moments which outshine much of what is out there.

  <center><h4>Control</h4></center>

  <p>
As usual, I find myself hesitating against playing computer games. On one hand, I've got an entire steam library filled with those, on the other - I just simply forget about the titles I wanted to play. It's kind of a constant nowadays, as all the stuff I wanted to do, there is just so much, they all just keep falling out of my head and then once I'm left alone contemplating on what I should be doing and taking the easy way of putting the gear of relatively easily consumable cultural titles, I kind of end up empty-handed. But even if I'm outside of the hypeloop, eventually I encircle back and narrow down on some developers, creators, some players who just create quality stuff. It's kind of like, the usual thing anyone does in life. You go to the baker you know to bake the good stuff. A good ramen place, a cheap hardware store, news outlet, I don't know. It all sort of works the same even for cultural titles. You know the authors and usually they stick to what they do, if they're really good, they evolve and create even more interesting things. That's the case with Remedy Entertainment, although, I must admit, I skipped their Quantum Break title.
  </p>

  <p>
  	I hopped onto this wagon, for a few reasons. Max Payne is probably the classic, I kind of still today adore. It's not easy to find a, should I call Max Payne 1 a triple A title? Story together with its storytelling, so fully fleshed out, technically mature, although its sequel takes the maturity torch to be fair. Two quite distinct, very strong video games with a story that ages well. The technical and visual part gets worse with the original but I still enjoyed Max Payne 2 after years. And you know, writing-wise, there is really not that many titles that can prove themselves to hold their bollocks on todays market, even considering the last 2 centuries combined. I'm not including indie games, to be fair, let's stay fair. Then there's also Alan Wake, which proved itself in my eyes to bolster what this company can do. I mean, now we're fighting darkness with light! Can't say if that's innovative or not but certainly flashing my torchlight at possessed shit being hurled at my presence and shooting all this vagueness encompassing the twin peaksy world, was fun. I also loved finding my flares and the story was fairly entertaining here too, although it seems Remedy starts dropping ball on the strength of the story in favour of introducing more intriguing and interesting projects. So, here was the episodic shooter, where the most important part was how freakin' lit your arsenal was, literally. Then Quantum Break, which seemed to have been carved between a TV Show and a game. Which didn't seem to resonate with everyone, I mean, heck! To find a good TV Show to watch these days and you want to blend it with a video game on top of it all? And now comes Control...
  </p>

<p>
	So, all I knew about Control was pretty much what I learned from Zero Punctuation, which I did some stuff and then I forgot about all that was mentioned. Except for the part in which Yahtzee actually mentioned he liked the game. Maybe he didn't. He didn't pull the game through the swaths of shit, as he usually does when he reviews any given game. And I also took a peek at some trailers back in the days, in which it all seemed rather intriguing. I mean, shapeshifting rooms and locations, a gun that has its elements levitating. Pretty good 3D scans. I don't know, these were the elements I noticed + that the game felt a bit more artistic. I guess Remedy ain't stading still, I liked this. So I proceeded with this.
</p>

<p>
	Well, on the shell the game started fairly interestingly. The game blends prerendered sequences and real-time rendering quite neatly. Until the point when I realised my hardware can't handle raytracing, I mean, the least you could do is say it's real-time raytracing, y'all making the audience confused now. The controls felt a bit like Alan Wake and the world's fidelity was interesting. I had to put some strain on the visual quality, as in, here, rendering quality, which made some things blurry every now and then. I think that's all I have to say about the technical aspect of this game. The framerate dips and drops every now and then but overall, it's not tragic. I had a few instances it got really jaggy but overall I never managed to kill the stability of this game. I think it may be using its own technology, which makes it rather impressive. There is a massive amount of elements that exist in this game. It is so meticulously crafted that I could not believe they went ahead with the idea of making it a third person perspective game. This is what the studio is known for but the design of this game really should've pushed for a first person perspective. All the locations feel as if they were extremely well thought-out and made nearly unbreakable. Well, as in, you can't get yourself glitched in one space. Cause in terms of breakability, this game, you can break literally anything around. Now here comes the impressive part - considering that you can turn entire spaces into rubble, I mean I walk into a toilet and launch a rocket which implodes and then explodes and it pulls everything: doors, toiletries, ceramics, concrete off walls and lights off the ceiling. It's a fantastic experience and the amount of particles that get launched along, honestly, I'm impressed this game doesn't get even larger dips. As I would normally seek cover in any shooter, here, I quickly get myself reminded by the exploding wall, that in this game, you gotta keep yourself constantly on the move, as most things on your way can get ripped apart and it does, constatly. Even yourself, you acquire abilities to hurl all sorts of shit in this game. Tables, fire extinguishers, huge water dispensers, computers - you name it, if there's an object in this game - huge chance you can hurl it at your enemy. And it's damn satisfying to do so, especially with all the particles launching around.
</p>

<p>
	To just add to the design part, there is great variety of locations the dynamisms of how they behave strongly reminds me of some more interesting levels in Dishonored 2. It's also quite amazing to see how the locations can prove to remain fresh despite treading through them repeatedly, as many places can become only uncovered once you gain new abilities. Although at some parts I would get lost or feel a bit claustrophobic and some would just become to hectic to carry out battles. The mechanics of this game are robust. So far I could not tell if anything really broke in the process. I need to praise the AI system as it kept myself on the move. Perhaps the friendlies would not be too useful but the enemies, their variety as well but their actions would constantly keep myself in harms way, to the point I had to employ different tactics to survive. Surprisingly, this game is fairly difficult. I was kept in some places around this game, which prevented me from moving forward due to me constatly failing, just because the attacks were either too abrupt or I was overwhelmed by enemies, who don't really need much to knock me out - there is no auto regeneration and the only way to regenerate is to acquire health thingies that enemies drop. If there is a boss fight, well, you need to just deal with it and these bosses can get really tough. There would be some surreal sequences in which the bosses could and would damage the floor, which would prompt me, unwillingly, to fall through it. I got frustrated quite a few times in the process, I feel the game should've been a bit better balances at times, although perhaps due to this, the game kept its freshness by remaining competitive. Freakin' Dark Souls era. One dev makes things too damn easy and then someone pulls the lever in a seperate directions and makes it too damn difficult and yet, gets millions to buy their game.
</p>

<p>
	The story part of the game feels less fresh. There is lots of references from previous games, the voiceover already makes it obvious. This all makes it actually quite neat, perhaps too many easter eggs does not make it all too many, in the end I need to praise the attention to detail again. On one hand, yeah, the design of this game and its locations, just how meticulous all is, is astounding. But it doesn't limit itself to this, writing is included in terms of just how many things you may find on your way. Alan Wake was quite notorious and amazing on this but in this game, there are just so many documents you can come across and they all have lots and lots of information, just story writing. It's immense. If anyone want to imbue themselves into this world, they honestly can. But in terms of the main story arc, I have some reservations. The storytelling part is quite varied and engaging but it kind of follows some tropes and overall doesn't come in my eyes as particularly strong, more of a filler of a slightly stronger caliber. The characters have some strength to them, as in, personality which carries on with some believability but nobody really felt absolutely amazing to follow. This feeling kind of went on with Remedies' titles, the strongest coming from Max Payne and slowly deteriorating (slightly) over the years. But, overall, it's good, even if it stingies a little. It may be a matter of preference as well. Honestly, I felt there wasn't much character development nor resolution happening, which was particularly interesting in Remedies' strongest titles (Payne, Wake).</p>

	<p>That having said, Remedy tried doing something a bit new here. I mean, hurling shit at enemies? Using different guns as part of your own? Picking up stuff and using it to empower yourself with better mods that do not overpower you but give a slight vantage? There is a mix of well working elements in the industry here and some stuff that wasn't really exactly done, or was but not at such fidelity. It just makes the entire combo just enjoyable due to its variety, novelty and good execution of core gameplay elements. And, I mean, I didn't even touch upon the artistic side, as the game constantly excels at providing a visual jumbo jumbo, with its intricate and subtle literal worldbuilding with also literal but not necessarily resolution of its world's alterations. I must also praise how complete this game feels. Nothing feels as if was left out or being unintentional (well, 96% of the game at least does). Nothing feels detached from the player and yet, as strongly as I would like to give it a 7, I'll just give a bonus bump for trying to pave new ways in the industry and not treating the audience like milk cows by delivering a finished product. Trust me, it's not a given, considering recent century.

  <center><h4>Trigun</h4></center>

  <p>
Man, I was looking for an Anime series. I eventually got to watch quite a few pilots but, oh man, once you run out of good classics to watch... then you remain with, in case on anime: weird one, even weirder ones and so weird that man, fuck this shit. Weird can also mean anything when you consider anime. You can get absolutely ridiculous level of sexualised characters, you can get violence pushed to a truly gruesome whole new level. What I'm usually after is some sort of a stricken balance. Something that, you can approach, which is fairly fresh and has something cool under its shell. The problem is, that I think I kind of watched most of it, most that is considered classic and that can be wrapped up under 26 episodes. In the end, a friend of mine recommended Trigun and I decided to give it a try.
  </p>

  <p>
  	First impressions were very positive, as it felt like a true classic. Western with some chunky ridiculous vibes of space and paranormal stuff. The thing was, that it got too goofy for my taste, despite the writing being really stellar. The problem with the older classics is that the writing does get a notch too cheesy at times and there are some formulas, that if they happened today, you'd call out on the lame writing. But at the time, it was what it was and the tropes, even if you sniff them from a mile, they're most of the time bearable to watch. This show has a decent mix of comedy and drama mixed in, although the ratios, even if fairly balanced, do hit some extremes on both ends. The ones that, as mentioned, it gets too goofy but it also gets a bit too dark at times, although, considering the circum... wait, what circumstances again? I think this actually just proves that the show is good. The creators do not hold back and actually deliver a quite interesting show overall to watch. The characters overall are strong. The main character, Vash, is especially one some kind of Jesus and also, Christian references come and go with a sting. I quite enjoyed following the philosophy carried out by the main characters and the story's development felt well-paced. Soundtrack could feel a bit repetitive at times but overall it had a signature to it (I think there's a more technical term to describe it?).
  </p>

  <p>
  	I also enjoyed the depicted world. There is always something a bit enriching about a certain fantasy of the unexplored worlds, the galaxy far away and beyond, something that we cannot quite just fetch. And those becoming a bit of a western wasteland like what's depicted in Trigun. But retaining much of the world's complexities, even if in a fairly detached structure. Some things are kind of left untold, some things are just simply bizarre, to the point of nearly amiss. But hey, I think Trigun's story was never about becoming a thing of a truly ambitious nature. A decent show, with some arcs told and untold, although it all with time narrows down and drives towards a quite neat conclusion. I think it's a good example of an Anime, of a genre that harbours good solid classics under its chassis (should it rather be, on its chassis? Nvm).

  <center><h4>Toy Story 4</h4></center>

  <p>
For this one I was going into the cinema believing that this is going to be a hit of a magnitude that Toy Story 1 was. I mean, going into the past! I mean, the advertisements really lured me in with the leading cast (which deterred me from seeing it in with a non-English dub) and just the cut out parts that I felt, that, yeah, this is going to be a great movie. And, I mean, it is a good movie. Except, that there is this thing that it wasn't, that's what I believe at least, it wasn't as overall emotional as at least some of the predecessors were or what I would except from a triple A animation to depict.
</p>

<p>
There is not much to say apart from this. It's a bit a dip into the past, the movies of your childhood. I just got to see a lecture, co-creator of Pixar at University of Sydney and he talked a bit about how all the years led to the creation of Toy Story and how moore's law generally contributed to them being eventually able to make this reality. Toy Story 4 isn't such a revolution, you know? It's a story. Generally, kind of captivating story that kind of connects more with parents, who see how their children eventually deter away to, I don't know, like, childhood I guess? Just that it less involves them, so it hurts and so it is conveyed with toys in Toy Story 4. But, ya know. An animation should contain more. Cause I'd risk stating that it is all about conveyance of emotions, why else exaggerate everything?
</p>

<p>
It's still a good movie and I'd recommend going to it with a kid if you have one. Otherwise, you know, it's a good movie but just don't expect it to carry god knows what. It's a continuation that just prolongs a well established series, that's all.

  <p>
Man, I don't even know if I should cover this one. Every now and then you end up watching a movie that, I mean, there's nothing bad about watching it. Except that it doesn't necessarily need a review. Here we have Kick-Ass, sequel of it. I mean the original was kinda fun to watch, concentrating on someone who decided to become a superhero, cause why not. The sequel kinda, well, continues this. And it extends in some ways but overall feels a bit trite and lacking, well, much in everything. But, you know, it's enjoyable so I'll just leave it at that.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
