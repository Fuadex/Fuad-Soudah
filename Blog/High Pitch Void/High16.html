    <center><h4>The Outer Worlds</h4></center>

    <p>
The were a couple of things I was fondly awaiting, coming closer till the end of this year. Obsidian Entertainment is one of those studios that, whatever they do and gets released, it gotta be good. So how hyped can one get once they hear they're doing a videogame that looks pretty much like Fallout but without Fallout in its name. See, these are the guys that did Fallout: New Vegas. A Fallout game that made its, sort of predecessor Fallout 3, look like a bit of a kid compared to its older, muscular and more aware brother. While Fallout 3 had some bold, powerful and successfully executed ideas such as the start of the game where you saw yourself being raised in a vault, then the light shock of going outside to the wasteland and I'd also throw in the idea of nuketown into the mix with a few more interesting aspects about the wasteland world and the wrap-up of the game (now that I look at what I wrote, it's actually quite a bit), Fallout: New Vegas was a much more refined product from its very start 'till finish. The way how your personality, perks and whatnot are assessed from the very beginning. How your story slowly unravels and how you discover the world bit by bit. How each of the world's factions you come across have refined backstories with ideologies embedded and encompassing nature. How your choices in fact felt as if they really weighed and mattered and impacted the depicted world with what you'd do, would directly blowback on how the world looked like. Amazing personalities and dialogue lines, fascinating developments and twists, it just felt like a fully fledged RPG game, that Fallout 3 could not really reach as it felt like Oblivion with Guns. There were some shortcomings and the atmosphere could have felt as somewhat more westerny than wastelandy looking but nonetheless I still remind of it quite rather fondly.
      </p>

      <p>
      	The outer worlds is somewhat a baby of the same studio and I think this studio also had some input in the earlier fallout games and classic RPGs as well. So, hopes were high. And these started to get a bit whoopy once I discovered, the game would tear and not run well on my PC for some weird reason. So... first of all, how come this kind of a game can run so badly, it doesn't even look like 2019, it still looks and behaves more like 2009. It's been almost a decade, why do you need more powerful computers to run a game that could've run on computers from a decade ago? The one I had, 4 years old, would not run it well anymore (GTX970) but my laptop (GTX1060), actually would. Or perhaps it's a matter of some other things... (HDD/SSD?). Nevermind.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Once I got this to run properly I would start to discover many good things about this game. The first world you land in looks... fascinating. There is so much new around here. And so much of this looks just so... beautiful. From the very get go you get to start using so of the abilities you craft at the beginning of the game. And to be fair, the RPG capabilities and its backend system is actually quite gracefully refined. You get a fair bit of XP from combat but also from completing quests. And you can talk to NPCs and get a chance of using special dialogue lines if you've got sufficient skills to activate them. At first it feels a bit complicated but it works really well once you get your head wrapped around it. Still, a little bit later in the game it seems as if all you get to change is really cosmetics, so the slight pressure of getting more XP and completing side quests remains valid for most of the game, until the very end which is a whole lot different story. Which on its own, is a fairly long story. And in theory there is lots of ways of going around it and completing it, which feels nice at least for a good part of the game.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Let's continue about the positives. The story actually takes off quite nicely and bombards the audience with a very kind depth. First encounter - corporationism, probably some of the worst of its kind. Then, you get to later experience others, some that pivoted more towards nature. More towards anarchy, more towards social reforms, pirates, outlaws etc. Basically the game will take you through all the social order the game is constructed of and showcase some of its extremes to its audience. A couple of times in my life I fantasized about creating a game of my own in which I would put different factions which would represent different socio-political ideologies. And it would seem that someone just went ahead and did just that. A corporation that cuts corners on every single thing, including their workers' wellbeing, where people don't know what weekend is and have to rent their own grave out in case they die? A settlement of wealthy people, where beaurocrasy chases its own tail, where people don't really work and complain how hard life is? You get much more and a pretty phenomenal spectrum of socio-political ideologies in extremes showcased in action, put together to certain extents that the writing even put me into awe. But there are problems in it.
      </p>

      <p>
      	First of all, the world doesn't quite change accordingly to the player's actions. I felt the same way in some cases pertaining to The Witcher 3, where I felt it almost threw me out of immersion to due this. But here, it doesn't even budge where and when it really should. Which kind of weighs off the immersion, cause for a role playing game, where your actions should impact the world, you don't exactly see this happening. This also is the same case when you clear some roads and hostiles respawn there, which feels a bit annoying at best. Then, there is the case of, especially, friendly NPCs. You get to put together a team of companions and... they all feel a bit random and lacking personality. More a bit like a bunch of youtubers, you kind of get to perhaps like some but not too much overall. They sometimes will engage in conversations you make across with other NPCs... but some stuff pertaining to their own lifelihood, where they will evoke strong opinions, afterwards if you try engaging them again, they won't really... say much at all. It all feels a bit contradictory the further you advance with the storyline. And it's a bit a shame, as this game had some good material but it all falls bland a bit. And then you start thinking...
      </p>

      <p>
      	...that it all was already here before in some ways. This entire ship thing, with an AI-built into it and companions. THIS IS MASS EFFECT! Except, they did a better job in Mass Effect, as after each main quest, you could engage in conversations with your crew members and they would actually respond in some even harsh ways to what you have done. They had better writing, although it was also a bit more straightforward in terms of how it all functioned but it did and well. It doesn't end there, though. There is kind of an equivalent of nuketown in this game once you advance later. There is literally a rip-off from The Walking Dead: The Game. Many ideas in this game freakin' come from other games and I'm not the one to judge whether 'borrowing' ideas from other games is bad, especially that they did it okay, in their own ways but... It feels unsavoury, the frequency of this and it impacts a whole lot of another thing - the quests are far from getting a surprising outcome. You can foresee much of what really happens in this game and that sort of ruins again, the immersion. You also get all those grand stories about how difficult some things are and then you run guns blazing and there is not that much of an effort done on your end. Also, the dialogue system is exactly like Fallout and the world looks a bit like Fallout.
      </p>

<p>
      This game is literally a cross of many games and I still actually liked it. The combat system was nice, the entire system was nice. But I could not help but notice that this game was somehow, as if, left unfinished. Perhaps severed in half? There are planets in the system that you do not end up exploring at all. There are storylines that were developed but were never really pursued in the end. Again, this thing with engaging in heated discussions with some characters in-game and the situation not impacting some other characters or the world altogether. It's as if the first part of the game got the most refining and then the latter started getting some... I don't know, becoming a nightmare of sorts to stitch everything together? Some locations are as-if clones and, I have to say this again, when this game was just about to start getting its momentum... Oh no! It just ended!

	  <center><h4>Mr. Robot Season 3</h4></center>

  <p>
Well, that was one strange ride. It's hard to classify this as hard or even strange actually. This was one good ride. Although, I wish I kept going ever since I have began this season. So, it kicks off quite primely, for people who were not acquainted with Mr Robot, the start serves everything on a plate in a rather convenient and unobtrusive manner. This, actually, I believe becomes a notch of a problem with this show. The problem being, that too much is actually revealed too early. It's an interesting creative take on the show, kind of depriving it of twists. And concentrating rather on the suspense, which in a way should degrade the show in my eyes but it does so in a quite stylish and nuanced way. The good thing is, that the show's creators do not cut short on their creative excesses, pouring interesting direction and scenography into the mix, imbuing it with some rather unconventional writing. The long takes are at times near paranormal. I have seen a share in my life but what they're doing here and how they're outperforming is astonishing. It really deserves some praise for how the show is being driven because it rolls quite fashionably so to speak. The attention to detail, juggling with styles, overall polish. Yeah, Mr. Robot shows off again as a solid watch that rattles some boundaries, but!
  </p>

  <p>
  	I had a bit of a problem following this season overall. First episodes, yeah pretty solid. And then it remains solid actually but somewhat, somehow I had real trouble following its advances. On one hand, I think its the show's dynamism that I lay blame on. There is just so much happening, which on its own is not really a bad thing. But from all this high performance bonanza nothing much jumps out for me to remember for years to come. It's a very weird feeling, cause as much as I would love to send praises and love for the show, I just can't, because it didn't really surprise me as much. Well, perhaps for the wrapping episode and the bottle episode, in terms of how detached the writing started to get but it all was somewhat made ok, cause in the end, the fitchery, beautiful way of keeping the conventions (un!) going, it remained a pleasant watch overall. Which is a bit scary. Put some bit nicer scenography and dialogues and all of a sudden, you don't have much problems dealing with stuff that just does not excel but is overall good.
  </p>

  <p>
  	I had a bit of a problem with the way this show was leading its storyline as well. The jumping between scenes made it lose its grit a bit. Sometimes the same feels with Elliot's personalities. It's a bit confusing at times to figure out exactly what's what. At times I also felt, that the dialogues didn't really actually get too great either. It's as if there was a bit of dissonance between what was being performed and what was being written. Perhaps that's what you would say an unconventional conventional show would be like. I don't know. Hard to say. It was good. In fact phenomenal for much of its time but somewhat somehow kind of brought it all down a massive notch. And that I can't pinpoint exactly what was the cause, actually is a bit scary.

  <center><h4>Bojack Horseman Season 6 P. 1</h4></center>

  <p>
Bojack's like wine, the older the better. Hold up, which way does he get older? With each season or the actually older seasons? Does Bojack grow any older in fact? Well, all these and more questions you may get answered once you delve into this and all the recent seasons. It could be a question of perception actually but throwing my mind back, I'd reluctantly stand by my original point of view - the show really evolved, very nicely. From a show that didn't really have that much of anything really, neither wit nor overall grit. So for a comedy-driven drama, it kinda unchecks the key boxes that make this a good show, wouldn't you assume? Well, no, because it was fairly well constructed actually. Perhaps not that memorable characters, not that powerful twists and generally leading storyline but you could follow fairly well and some jokes could get to ya.
  </p>

  <p>
  	But the show kinda started ramping up, I think season 4 was he one that started with a slightly more subtle radical shift in how it was being driven. Some changes were being introduced which kicked the dynamism up and overall driving the story was much more nicer and surprisingly coherent, leading somewhere, started changing some of the characters. It was really, really enjoyable and I praised the shift but with the subsequent Season 5, the creators decided to go crazy with each episode being driven in an original way. Playing with dynamics, time, characters' portrayal, storyline, everything - risky but how affective even! Just like with many shows that I've watched that more or less similarly beefed up on quality I was cautiously eager to see what this time the folks decided to bake, especially that it was quite long quiet on what's really happening with this. And then it came out, with first half, kinda smells like Breaking Bad all over, although these are two different calibers of shows. First episode was a let down. What came after? Yeah, a flavoursome mix. A great influx of references and really, really good jokes infused into this. Not that massively subliminal anymore, or maybe? Just delivered in a more direct, still twisted but phenomenal way. I had a great time following these, in the end, I was watching a great comedy! But, as it's Bojack, it's with a massive grim twist. And that's infused there too, this time a bit more, stronger, harder as the emotional baggage became oversize and throws the audience into a bit of a bi-polar, emotional journey. You kind of start developing emotional bond with this story's characters now, like really. Because of how well constructed all of this is, finally! Even if off-beat at times, I had a great time.
  </p>

  <p>
  	So, there's a nice chunk of emotional distress involved. Alcoholism, Depression, Anxiety, other mental illnesses. Crossed with the very visceral portrayal of, I presume, how the Californian Society functions but I'm sure you can level with the parallels established with wherever you'd be living currently. I, for once, saw all of this actually more or less, quite accurate. I liked also how this show doesn't cut slack on any groups, it rolls its tank over literally just everybody. The personas are shown with the face they want to show, the face that is seen by many others around and what's behind the face, hollowed out and put out for the audience to see, in more or less subliminal and deeper way. The writing is fantastic on this one, it really is. And sadly, it eventually ends with the wrapping up episode, which becomes a mess, contrary to first which was much more coherent but a bit shallow overall.
  </p>

  <p>
  	It's a bit of a difficult choice of how to rate this one. Considering it's a series, I'll give it a 9, just because of its highs and how the high remained for the general majority of this season and how well it reflects compared to its preceding seasons. I'm curious to see how it will wrap up. I don't expect fireworks, I'm a bit counting on a big fall of a cliff, metaphorical. It's a real pleasure seeing how some shows, pick up from being a bit over average and evolve into fully fledged productions that I can honestly say I followed with pleasure.

  <center><h4>The Irishman</h4></center>

  <p>
I have a tendency to not follow the mainstream flow of whatever's swimming in the river. Scorsese's movies are kinda falling into this spectrum, that said, many things happening in the mainstream can be deemed good. I could hardly take into my own account articles saying 'Wolf of Wall Street best Scorsese's movie to date!' and I would not end up watching it until very recently. Yes, good movie but the best? Out of all the great movies that came out of this director's hands, not to mention that I did not see most of his movies? I mean, in the end, many of these movies, they've been around for decades, can they still be deemed as movies that have been seen by everyone? I don't know, I haven't seen Hitchcock's movies, I haven't seen many others that were hits years prior. Just recently I've been to the GP and I've been watching a comedy in B&W, couldn't tell the name of it, or even have the slightest idea.
  </p>

  <p>
  	So, how does that corelate with The Irishman? Well, this is yet another production, that I deem as one of those, that, probably would have great problems to get the necessary funding and even if it did, all sorts of limitations would fall into place, strangling the hands of whoever'd be in steers of this gig. But instead, a big guy like Netflix comes in, who doesn't give a single fuck. Unconstrained by swaths of stakeholders, they just know the right people and the right people are looking for funding. As it turns out, Netflix has the funds and just says 'do it.'. So what do the right people do? They just do. They just know other people, who know what to do and how to do it well. They all work as a gigantic orchestra that gets the job done and they do it the way they know how to. The director, the actors, the scenographers, the janitors, the microphone people, the guys from editing, post production, everything. They're getting paid, they're told 'here's the vision', everyone gets it and in the end the movie comes out, everyone loves it, everyone's happy. Kind of idyllic sounding, doesn't it?
  </p>

  <p>
  	But that's the era of Netflix I presume. Not to say that Netflix does that all the way, in fact there's a lot that they don't do well. But they get a small percentage right and they have competition in place too, which seems to be doing quite nice job, quite oftentimes as well like Amazon Prime or HBO, which has been known to deliver for years. Can't say about the percentage of productions but, you know, we all have limited time, perhaps it's for the best that we don't get spammed with all but jagged quality.
  </p>

  <p>
  	So what about The Irishman? Well, first of all, it's a complete movie. It goes from A to Z quite nicely, in its own flow. And the flow is actually quite stellar, the dynamics so smooth that the 3.5h spent in cinema fly by relatively, well, you kind of don't feel it due to the amazing immersion. You get imbued into this world very nicely and it's very tangible. The attention to detail is great. Dialogue lines top-notch, everything feels like from the old gangster movies done by Scorsese and the cast is like from another dimension, I mean, the two/three and prior decades ago dimension. It's like, there would be not other time to get such movie done, it's already late but they got it done with so many of these actors still today. And they managed to do this all smooth deaging process in a very effective and seamless way. Technology has gone through tremendous advancements, really.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Let's talk about a few things that I did not like. While performance of main actors was great (especially Pesci!), you could sense a bit of, well, that these actors are just old now. De Niro does show a bit of this, especially in the scenes where he plays an older person, well, I guess himself. The VFX lacks a punch in some scenes, just feels artificial at some of the flicks. And I think that's... pretty much it? Seriously, if there is not that much more to actually be critical about, especially knowing how much I like to throw meat around, I guess it really is a veery good movie. People clapped at the end of it in the cinema I went to and it was rather a small crowd too. Perhaps that says something? The minute I left the cinema, I felt as if I was still in the 90s or even decades earlier. I guess that could pinch the quality badge in. Very well done. It's a good year.

  <center><h4>Toy Story 4</h4></center>

  <p>
For this one I was going into the cinema believing that this is going to be a hit of a magnitude that Toy Story 1 was. I mean, going into the past! I mean, the advertisements really lured me in with the leading cast (which deterred me from seeing it in with a non-English dub) and just the cut out parts that I felt, that, yeah, this is going to be a great movie. And, I mean, it is a good movie. Except, that there is this thing that it wasn't, that's what I believe at least, it wasn't as overall emotional as at least some of the predecessors were or what I would except from a triple A animation to depict.
</p>

<p>
There is not much to say apart from this. It's a bit a dip into the past, the movies of your childhood. I just got to see a lecture, co-creator of Pixar at University of Sydney and he talked a bit about how all the years led to the creation of Toy Story and how moore's law generally contributed to them being eventually able to make this reality. Toy Story 4 isn't such a revolution, you know? It's a story. Generally, kind of captivating story that kind of connects more with parents, who see how their children eventually deter away to, I don't know, like, childhood I guess? Just that it less involves them, so it hurts and so it is conveyed with toys in Toy Story 4. But, ya know. An animation should contain more. Cause I'd risk stating that it is all about conveyance of emotions, why else exaggerate everything?
</p>

<p>
It's still a good movie and I'd recommend going to it with a kid if you have one. Otherwise, you know, it's a good movie but just don't expect it to carry god knows what. It's a continuation that just prolongs a well established series, that's all.

  <p>
Man, I don't even know if I should cover this one. Every now and then you end up watching a movie that, I mean, there's nothing bad about watching it. Except that it doesn't necessarily need a review. Here we have Kick-Ass, sequel of it. I mean the original was kinda fun to watch, concentrating on someone who decided to become a superhero, cause why not. The sequel kinda, well, continues this. And it extends in some ways but overall feels a bit trite and lacking, well, much in everything. But, you know, it's enjoyable so I'll just leave it at that.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
