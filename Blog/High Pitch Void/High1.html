    So I just watched a movie. I had some trouble approaching some cultural forms lately, as some just bored me to sleep, such as 'For a Few Dollars More'. I'm quite sure that it may be quite a watch, nevertheless I was looking for something a tiny bit more ambitious formwise. I especially grew fond of some productions made outside of English-first countries, so I got marvelled with quite solid all-round German 'Dark', really impressive mariage between Polish Pitbull (original TV series) and The Wire with a notch more dramatic turnaround - Italian 'Gomorra' and today I got to see a production which felt a little off, but once I read a notch more as a follow-up, seems as a great companion if only it was a tv show, that is Brazilian 'City of God' (Cidade de Deus).<br><br>

  </div><br>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Favela</h4></center>
    I tried to roll into the production like usual, a bit without knowing what to expect as to receive the largest blow. I didn't even know what others thought of it but it was on netflix and the +18 rating sort of insinuated a relatively promising experience. A brazilian movie, that is rated for adults and pictures favelas? Likely something extreme, but well, let's check it out, shall we? The opening shots of Miramax a bit pushed me aside, but I figured, hell it could be good. And so it began, with actors that I did not know. A poster featuring a kid having a gun held to his head. Further into the movie, we'll see more kids with even more guns. This is certainly one of the movies that would definitely have some trouble getting done if it was to receive some large budget and the bunch providing the finances would know the details of what is about get made. That having said, it is one of those movies and it is one of those good ones as well. Definitely not dedicated for everyones eyes, but quite ambitious, thorough, multilayered and exotic, depicting a wide range of problematique, a spectrum that particularly touches upon Brasil with all its gang-related issues, encompassing times quite in the past and a bit more recent.<br><br>

    It's gritty. It's in its way innocent. Quite detailed and avant-garde in some moments in terms of how the directing was undertaken. One particularly interesting part that I found in the movie is how well the acting was done. I don't know much about Portugese and the language spoken in the movie felt particularly confusing for some reason. And while I'm at the confusing, the description of the movie feels a bit misleading as it doesn't feel as if it really depicts two different kids. It sort of depicts them all, from all top to the very bottom, although all of them are in the movie, sort of and the ways how it all went on and just was. It gives an insightful glimpse on why and how the favelas were born, although at a limited version, deprived of politics and concentrating on the people, who, as I understood it from the movie, were just merely outcasts of the society that did not really care about the ones who got affected: whether homeless or touched by the hand of God, by floods or other forms. The creators seem to have employed the same philosophy as the ones who created The Wire, they employed bunch from the actual Favelas (in many cases, according to imdb) and hence, the entire setting and play did feel completely natural. All of the aforementioned, paired with an quite great pacing and screenplay that intertwined with itself every now and then, did merge into quite a relatively, or even not, I'd say a phenomenal movie.<br><br>

    Nevertheless, I did wish it was longer and that it harboured more content, especially what came after. Perhaps that's what the follow-up movie tried to depict, but that's not what I'm reviewing here, am I? Some parts did lack, some characters for instance. Also one of the final movie's scenes felt extremely far-fetched, even by my standards it was just too much and the creators made sure the audience knows exactly what and why. Fair enough, it does make the movie feel more complete, but to be honest, it shouldn't be the case that the audience is required to know everything. Technically speaking, great approach. But then, the movie is apparently based on a real story and all the elements that are introduced and directly are associated with some other events that came up during the movie, just take away the entire natural vibe of a movie, that absolutely does not cut slack in terms of its own feel. It's pretty much what you would expect from a group of people with complete artistic freedom, who worked hard in the name of creating something of value. It is a good movie. It conveys ideas and a story. And provides with additional depth to a setting that may not be easy to depict, due to its being endemic hence, challenging. I mean, Brazil still didn't manage to fix what's wrong with the rogue elements of their society. If they knew, they would have probably fixed it by now? Right? Right?<br><br>

    Scorching hot. Outside merely 29 degrees, although with humidity reaching its peaks, within four enclosed walls it feels more as if I had en suite sauna. Tha latter with its walls knocked down, raising the temperature and testing out my sanity on how to carry on with my life, that sort of still is enclosed within the aforementioned four walls. Kind of the High-Pitch Void I planned on writing about, but never really headed off towards this sweet area of writing all-round of all-everything, as nothing that I managed to spout really made any sort of an impression. Sadly. Cause even when I look back at what I managed to scramble back in the days, I felt exactly the same way. Although the quality does seem higher, all considered<br><br>

    So another idea struck me as I watched City of God, hell, I should probably carry on with, yet another blog! Hell yeah, why not, chip in yet another page, get some time allocated to it, perhaps something will pop up and time squandered, desptie that I'm in dire need of, but it doesn't seem as if I'm doing anything better at the moment, anyway, am I? It's kind of interesting to find out that I may still be able to carry out these words as I thought I managed to walk away from all the dire and gritty commenting, to which unfortunately I will need to get back to every now and then, as it is an integral part of my life and history really, but hell. I've got plans! I've achieved *some* stuff!<br><br>

    So by looking back and into and figuring that I may actually be able to pop some valuable commenting up, I decided that perhaps I'd set up a facebook page. Hell yeah? I mean someday I might need it. But then I figured, that hold up. I don't have a name really for that, do I? Do I just name it Fuad? But there are tons of Fuads out there? Fuadex? Doesn't sound professional now? More like a gamer of sorts and sadly I don't play as many games nowadays, some sort of an evolution did eventually get to me. So what's left? Oh, right, hold on. Blogger? Wordpress? Wait a minute, didn't I just spend a fuckton of time on prepping up myself a fancy-looking website? How about I utilize that?<br><br>

    And so there it is. I'm probably about to do it the hard way, but you know what? It looks good and I'm actually quite proud of where I stand now, so how about this is the first blog entry and we'll see where it takes me, eh?<br><br>
