    <p>Final stream for this year, eh? Ough... Wait, it's already new year? 2019? Hey, I'm not looking to bad now except I have no idea how I'll be looking in 2020. It would be cool to have a quiet house, a case of pale ale and roughly a few good media to roll over and squeeze till I munched on the very last bit. But what I'll likely end up with is a crazy ass city, bag of mate and a bunch of media I'll have to create myself and I'll never be satisfied with</p>

    <p>
      That having said, it didn't go off to a really bad start. Here's some of the stuff I caught up with.

  <center><h4>Blade Runner 2022 (Short Anime)</h4></center>

  <p>
    I've kept this little monster hidden at the depths of my Chrome tabs, as in one of those things I wanted to get cleared someday and eventually it actually happening. I'm just as surprised as you are, especially that some of the materials I've got there require time and I'd just love to blaze through all of what I kept behind but tangled somewhere. I figure that's a good thing but in the end it keeps you living in the past which is good and bad. But now, sometimes some really amazing pieces come afloat as I untangle them and I did come across one truly beautiful piece.
  </p>

  <p>
    I mean, Blade Runner 2049 was already an amazing movie that I gazed at with utmost pleasure. The combination of aesthetics, depth of the depicted universe, amazingly refreshed themes. Oua, I love such feasts. But I did not expect that additional, rather promotional materials are going to be just as or in parts even surpassing the good that's been in the original. But what could be expected of any other than Sinchiro Watanabe? Whatever this guy creates, tends to be at least good and this piece just proves how amazing can become even more amazing in the right hands. Think of bleak themes, dystopian future with androids and levels of references blended with questioning human nature, existance and concentrating a full-feature in just less than 15 minutes. You figure that's too much? Well but there's also an artistic feast, that drops a bit on the animation part but makes up with stunning direction and putting resources into key cuts that remain with you for time to come.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's just one of those shorts that you may remember due to just those key moments.

    <center><h4>Man in the High Castle</h4></center>

    <p>
      Well, there was Blade Runner so I figure chucking in Man in the High Castle seems about right. Ever feel like opening netflix but there's nothing interesting to see? Or opening steam and there's nothing to play all of a sudden? Or opening your laptop and realising that it's +35 degrees and the thing won't run even google chrome well? Oh well, good thing there's power saving mode and streaming services are optimised to run even on a bunch of calculators. That having said, there was literally nothing on netflix and I figured, perhaps it could be a good idea to look into Amazon Prime and what it has in store, as I did not quite use it much but turns out, it was a mistake. It's a very weird platform but in combination with my vpn and even without it, I am able to play an impressive selection from Australia, German and American services in some weird combination that's either a success or fail, same goes for the availability of specific shows. Where Amazon Prime seems to have an upper hand in, is the availability of HBO shows and (WB?) movies. It's a shame I've seen so many of them, already. But not from Amazon Prime, not quite and yet, though...
    </p>

    <p>
      Man in the High Castle came as an interesting title due to it gathering pretty good reviews back from what I recalled. So that + me being excited with Dick Universe (no pun intended) I figured I'd check what so many were crazed about (I'm serious, no puns intended, he's a real author, don't blame me for English/Americans naming their kids 'Dick's), so I delved into the show which greeted with a quite inviting pilot...

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
