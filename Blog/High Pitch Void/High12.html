    <p>
    	Hmm.. Let's see, while I'm still in the old continent, I figured I'm gonna take a look at some real old stuff. Honestly, for me, my wellbeing, it's usually best if I don't spend too much time not doing much. As suddenly it turns out, that where I used to live, it wasn't truly exceptional. It puts you into perspective, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the drum-kit from Guitar Hero, prompted me, that I had a PS3 that I didn't really use as much. And then, an old decoder downstairs reminded me, that there used to be a channel I'd watch called Game One, which pretty much got me into the whole remix gig, at least accelerated it after having seen some others on youtube. And also Corridor Digital, which I discovered via Freddiew channel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both Corridor and GameOne turned out to be really amazing. And so I'm watching playlists on youtube, a bit too much frankly. But I'm also rediscovering and learning so much...

  <center><h4>The Naked Director</h4></center>

  <p>
  	This show is made to be just as entertaining as porn. In fact, it imitates a lot of the features that you could associate with porn which is extremely interesting to see and probably even demanded from a show, that particularly takes within its lens a story of a porn director. Which makes it even spicier, is the fact its about a Japanese porn director and what would seem even more interesting, is that most of the setting also takes place in Japan. Knowing my first feelings and knowledge associated with Japan, how they misguided with what I actually experienced in Japan, then learned even more and saw in this movie, all turned into a bunch of thoughts that kind of left me puzzled and particularly entertained. It's just, the fact how Japanese customs are and how leniently they were depicted in this show, it's difficult to figure out what exactly you are seeing - is this the real? Is this fiction? Most likely fiction but entertaining this fiction is and despite how entertainingly it is being acted out and lead throughout with all its unbelievable twists and turns of events and the ridicule of certain characters' arcs happening, especially at the very beginning of the show, with its mere pilot you're being braced for a journey sort of one of a kind, as its being fresh, very well written, in a way oriental and so going hand in hand with its sort of a clashy entertainment fusion of the far east but in a very approachable format for the western audience. Very unlikely match, paradoxically but working wonders in this case.
  </p>

<p>
I enjoyed the way the producers managed to keep the integrity and dynamics of the show through-on-out, despite it marking a dip mid-way in how blissfully fast it progressed, the character build-up, nitty-naughty dialogues, really not much of any problems with acting that I had, all-in-all great writing and scenario structure, even if fantastical in many cases, very much still believable to even far-fetched extents, the depiction of cultural boundaries and how these were tested in the Japanese setting, it all just comes down to a very enjoyable watch. It's obvious the creators didn't have much break handles engaged while filming all this and I must say, this is also a very unique watch considering the themes its depicting. It's a binge-worthy show, it keeps you engaged for long and doesn't let go easily.
</p>

<p>
I also wonder what the concentration here really was placed in. I mean, to think about it, its not exactly the characters but also the characters. Its like we are watching a set of phenomena that are the focus but at the same time it is the director himself with whom the audience can sympathise with and a mixed-up protagonist and yet the good guy but the story nicely stretches out onto just the theme itself and even what would seem as supporting acts, they all actually do very well in this show to the mark that you just keep to it and following the action as a whole. Big surprise for me here.

    <center><h4>Aquaman</h4></center>

    <p>
    	It's a bit difficult to grade movies that you watch in-transit. Like in an airplane in which you did not really finish watching the movie but according to your own cognitive reasoning, you feel like, yeah, you kind of know what you're watching and whether it is good or bad. Aquaman is an interesting example and I have one more up my sleeve but. The movie according to what I've seen is technically good. It's fairly long but all of its segments seem to encompass high quality visual effects, solid acting and phenomenal choreography. I just could not get through the setting of the universe, which drove me off from going to the cinema but, ya know. Sometimes you end up in an airplane vessel with not much to do and not much will to go to sleep so you end up reaching for what entertainment there is at disposal. Aquaman was a quite good hit to experience actually.
    </p>

<p>
Good direction, nice effects and depiction of the underwater world. I fairly liked the dialogues and enacted scenes, although some felt underwhelming. The thing that the work made up with was the choreography and so, therefore, the fighting scenes. Even if certain parts did feel off, eventually they would turn out digestible just due to the execution of such scenes. I also wonder how come many people end up criticizing the work actually in the extent that I actually liked the movie. For instance, the special effects, acting etc. I see there is still an easily perceivable rift between Marvel and DC movies with each settlement attacking the other but honestly, the people behind the DC world, they honestly seem to put the scale often higher compared to its counterparts and extend the show to be truly, more of an epic than a drama focused on particular characters and their popularity. This is not always the case but I see a certain course of action with marvel moving towards developing characters, especially its main protagonists but also with supporting acts becoming with time the main. DC feels a bit different, as if actually focused on developing the world which I like to see in such high-budget movies, in the end, with a budget you'd like to show more than less, at least just because you can.
</p>

<p>
Still, in the end Aquaman was a movie that was a good show to enjoy, especially underway to someplace. It's not an ambitious watch but it will provide a fair bit of good to lay your eyes on and it's just simply an enjoyable watch with not so many caveats attached.

  <center><h4>Animatrix</h4></center>

  <p>
  	Unbelievable craftsmanship but it all kind of fades in the context of how the story's written. Averagely and highly disintegrated at best. From the point in time when I know its younger brothers and sisters in the form of love death and robots, I must state that the original form as in Animatrix must have been quite a stunning set to watch at the time. However, there is frankly a bit of an unstable match between the depicted stories, which was not quite the case with LDR. Perhaps it is the time all this was released, you can't expect CGI to be world class at the time. But at the very least you could make it up with writing, which just isn't to the quality you'd expect and it does lack coherence. It also lacks more sublime moments. There is a quite stunning variety incorporated into the show and the author I specifically watched this movie for, Sinichiro Watanabe, uplifted the quality overall with the two episodes featured within.
  </p>

<p>
The thing with anthological structures, though, it's not easy to build anything of scale. Especially ever since the only thing you can end up building is a show that will last a couple, at best, a bit more than ten minutes long short. Whenever anyone is interested in showcasing a vision, it often is the case the grandiose of the visual more befits a TV show rather than a movie and especially not a mere short, in which every single second technically counts. It's also the question about the artistic vision incorporated to execute the project and technology. In the end, in Animatrix, it was often the animation style which made the most powerful wow. I have seen a bit so far but it would seem that animation techniques can stretch out to such lengths and variations, that we haven't really seen the end of it all. Which is sort of the case with many form of media, I would even argue the same goes of photorealism, I mean there is so much we can stretch it out to but as animation being extremely susceptible to human imagination and the stretching its vulnerable to, suddenly you end up watching at least one part of the movie, that you're like - oh my, what have they done here!
</p>

<p>
In comparison to the original Matrix, this is a sort of a bit of a different pair of shoes to compare against. The general feel I'd say was preserved and there is a lot of philosophical arguments lead throughout the movie, all kept in some varieties that are bound with the artistic form some of the shorts represented but overall it was an enjoyable show, especially pertaining to the parts that made you go like - oh, this is beautiful! And how this beauty was decided to come to a close by its authors.

  <center><h4>The Lego Movie</h4></center>

  <p>
Oh man, this is an intense movie. And it is so entertaining and there is so much happening. I love the animation style and the number of references that sprawl all over, kind of all the time, a little bit off-beat. The quality of the animation is super-b, the pacing and the elements that correlate between the real and the unreal go hand in hand and whenever needed, special effects are substituted for lego formulas. It's an imagination feast and that's what is best about this movie. The elaborate ways in which the creators decided to flex out certain situations, balancing between the hollywood and the animation-bound non-limitations. It's just exhilirating, especially with the stellar cast that was involved in the creation. Imagine Gandalf Morgan Freeman, woo!
  </p>

  <p>
  	The thing is, it was one of these movies that I was watching in an airplane but I finished it back home. I learned a little bit about the technology behind it and why this lego movie looked so good as it did. It's one of those movies that both kids and parents will have a great time watching, each for different reasons. The score is great, the storyline feels very much inline with what lego is and provides a bit more to it, a bit of chunkyness to feel and enjoy. As in, this actually has a pretty good story, as absurd and dilluted as it may seem, it all fits its boundaries and the imagination feast, which this movie is, kind of backs everything that is happening.
  </p>

  <p>
  	On my second complementary run of this movie, though, I saw that all this that I enjoyed so much, it's good perhaps even great but somehow there was a lot that I was not seeing anymore. There is perhaps this thing that, some media are great for particular devices. I liked watching it on a smaller screen. Once I engaged my laptop, it was a bit of a different experience, with much kinda going under the radar and I can't help but point out that the conclusion kinda kicked down a little bit, even by a major blow, derailing a bit the immersion and overall experience. That doesn't necessarily diminish what was achieve beforehand but still, somehow it went sideways. Still an enjoyable watch!

  <center><h4>Man in the High Castle Season 3</h4></center>

  <p>
  	The form started to bland with the new season as it explores format that are already being warped around to ridiculous extents. Suddenly we've got a blend of family, sexuality, paranormal features and secondary themes that just do not seem to just cut it. The series decides to go a bit Lost, literally. What would seem like an end of material that stemmed from the books, just pupated into something that just blatantly forms into a statement - we don't know what to do with this series anymore, so we'll just keep it rollin' with a bit of intrigue and perhaps something to fill it up with.
  </p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad. In fact, there are a few interleaving intrigues going on, a few of a quite mighty interest but there are things happening that kinda contradict me believin' what is actually happenin'. There are also some minor shifts that took place in terms of the main characters, which probably resulted from surprising turns of events. Some things that many would deem impossible, suddenly decided to just happen in this season. While the paranormal things were rather tolerable in previous seasons, here they start stepping out of proportion and tread into areas that I'd call wolfenstein-like. I mean, fine. But, can I ask where does it all lead and why it's being lead as it is?
</p>

<p>
I do however like the many details that thrall through this show that adhere to a variety of totalitarian systems and its features being meaningfully incorporated into the depicted world. This way it does not entirely fall flat with its believability, although some parts of the world feel more robust compared to the others. I also enjoyed the dedication to keeping the world detailed via the really highly performant acting. The cast is doing a stellar job and that didn't really change since the previous seasons. But it's like I said, it's as if the showrunners are starting to lose track of what they're supposed to be doing and that's a shame. Filling it up with secondary themes just does not do the job well.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
