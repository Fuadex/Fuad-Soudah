    	There are loose ends one needs to tie up. I mean, you might decide to not do it, nobody tell you not to do it, some people might keep telling you that you have to do it. But really do you? I mean, in my case, I really like to do stuff for my personal interest in constant development. Sometimes this fades away. Sometimes it comes back. Keeping this at bay and sustain is the hardest part 'cause projects have a start and an end. And I like to go all-out on them but once they end? I mean, as a locomotive still rumbling and kept in motion, that kind of machinery is not easy to take to a halt. And if it keeps going without an objective.
    </p>

    <p>
      I mean, I don't know. The locomotive doesn't know. Who might know? Does know know?

  <center><h4>Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</h4></center>

  <p>
This is an example of a phenomenally executed feature film from end to end. It takes under consideration, I'd say everything. The original comics Spiderman is based on but also the movie adaptations. It manages to feature variations of the concept and successfully rebuilds the showcased world based on the variety of world that this movie goes through. The dialogues are rich, animation style is just simply beautiful and detailed, altogether with camerawork (is there actually any? I couldn't tell how exactly this movie was created really). I loved how it portrayed strong cultural references and the feel and dynamism of New York, so that the movie went in breadth and depth, not only in case of Spiderman context but also in terms of the city it was based on (that only New Yorkers will likely get), the backgrounds of the leading characters and of course the context of the main storyline that takes place. It also phenomenally depicts different visual styles, which you'll get once you get your eyes set on the movie.
</p>

<p>
Which in fact, is a pleasure to watch from the very beginning till end. It's very dynamic and it keeps its dynamism through-on-out. This should not be taken as granted from an animated movie, the creators often resort to a variety of tricks so that they can minimise the amount of work they put, here it seems they didn't care about how much the movie will total in, I mean from the looks of it, it seem like a massive venture, all the way from illustration to animation to VFX to post-production and final touches. Even the special effects here are so imaginative and detailed that I was left in constant awe of just how beautifully created this movie is with an all-out pleasure associated with following the feature.
</p>

<p>
I also massively enjoyed that the storyline seems relatively bulletproof, with indiscernible twists, very well written characters and their lines, of course the aforementioned visuals but also they implemented some interesting techniques in the animation itself, sound work is top-notch, the multitude of references and just the sole element of paying attention to every single detail that takes place in the movie, making it one of those that you'll enjoy watching over and over. It's an absolute feast to for your mind and eyes and I would highly recommend seeing it if you yet haven't. I mean, this one won an Oscar for an animated movie. And it wholeheartedly deserved it.

    <center><h4>Blade Runner</h4></center>

    <p>
Ahh... So I finally got to watch the original Blade Runner, after the sequel 2049. It seemed to have received some mixed reviews. I don't know what's that about, I absolutely loved it. I loved a few elements that particularly stood out, the subliminality of it. The entire artistic elevation and all. So that would mean that somewhat similar elements were to be experienced in the original, prompting the sequel to become, what it became?
</p>

<p>
Well, yes. And yes but yes. So enigmatically described as such, there was one more short created by Sinichiro Watanabe which I recommend everyone to see as it's beautiful for a short (most what Sinichiro creates is beautiful imho). And I think a show is being made based on this too, an animated series which I am extremely looking forward to seeing. I mean, cause why would I not be? It's about a future with artificial intelligence and artificial human beings who look just as we do but are better. We have a dystopia. We have a world in which it seems like a cross between all the countries in the world. A chaotic world, where everyone seems to be adept in a variety of computer systems. A neo-futuristic dystopia that just remains alive but the question remains what it means alive and what it means to be alive in this world, in which nothing seems to give you any hope for a better future. A future, which remains enthralled in darkness all the time and so fixed in the contemporary.
</p>

<p>
After sprawling a chunk of twisted philosophical terminology, I must say that I was very impressed with the setting and how believable it was overall depicted. The detail put into creating the fictional world and how well put together everything was, the overall design and feel, it's in fact hard to go out and find a second movie like this that showcases such a neo-futuristic (or perhaps should I say, retrofuturistic) dystopia at such depth. Overall the movie feels contained in terms of the storyline it features but it also concentrates on the atmosphere, I feel. There is a lot of art imbued into Blade Runner and perhaps through that lens it should be explored, along with philosophical disputes. The acting is stellar, the overall technical quality of the movie is nothing to be criticised on honestly. It's a captivating feast that explores a potential future we might end up in, with a bit of the corporate, a bit of the social mix and clash and overall dipped quality of living, succumbing into a dystopian chaos that sort of retains its integrity just because it has to.
</p>

<p>
Well, I don't know, watch it for yourself and dwell by yourself, I don't want to impose my own interpretation. It's like time travel to a different atmosphere, universe and world that only you can decipher really.

  <center><h4>Parasite</h4></center>

  <p>
I think this was a movie that made quite a bit of a, I don't know actually what it did, except that it won Palm D'Or, a quite massive distinction that a movie creator might ever get. I mean, everyone wants an Oscar. But from where I sit, it would seem Palm D'Ors land into hands of people, who create a bit more interesting storytelling features and step outside of the boundaries that movies are set and contained within. Is Parasite one of these movies?
</p>

<p>
Well, for the first half of the movie I can set with my utmost certainty, it is not. Although it portrays a very interesting setting and aforesets a strong distinction between people from low and high socioeconomic backgrounds, again, in a unique Korean setting. After visiting the country for a month, I could see a lot of what was in the movie through my own set of lenses. To some extent, at least. The thing is that this movie is primarily a comedy for this first half, a very much grotesque comedy with a strong emphasis on the grotesque-side but still it's kinda directed in a way, that I felt ambivalent about. People in the theatre would laughs at many moments but I could not quite do it along, sure some lines were fantastic but they lacked depth that I was looking for. And so as it turns out with this particular type of works, whether it's in film, video games, literature or wherever, it sometimes happens that the work progresses in a rather plain average if nothing more or less way and then something happens.
</p>

<p>
This something was kind of structured and put the movie together in a layered way. Suddenly, the movie gains an additional depth that I was looking for. Suddenly, it shifts from being a mere grotesque, comedy into something bit more radically grotesque, splitting its nature into a dichotomous structure in which parallel sides of the movie coexist. And it further adds on complexity with a calamity that reveals a climax. It's like a stomp, the audience does not foresee the unravelling, which really does actually wrap the movie. It's just, we don't see this type of works nowadays, we don't see that much of juggling between styles, that from something trivial shifts to the bleak and heavy, mixing the grotesque and suddenly seeing that a bit too much of the bitter just flooded into the mix, pushing out the sweet and leaving it somewhere, suspended, that we know it's there but overall can't get out of our head what pursued the final mix.
</p>

<p>
The movie does feel a bit stripped of the deeper venture into the socioeconomic clash, rather remaining by the exploration of how one group takes advantage of the other and how the system comes into the mix. But, with all due honesty, even if this type of movie gets awarded, perhaps it's for the better to give a signal, that we want to see more of the braver approach to cinematography. Perhaps there's nothing that really brave about Parasite but it definitely went down a path that as a whole was ultimately rather quite impressive to follow 'till the end.

  <center><h4>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h4></center>

  <p>
Ahh, how I was hearing about how this might be the best Tarantino movie and his last feature film, da-da-da, bla bla bla, whatever. I like Tarantino movies anyway, a bit obscure and definitely violent but hey, it's rather always an enjoyable watch. Like, directed by a guy who wants it his way, not caring about what others have to say cause it's Tarantino. So, I went to the cinema and decided to give it a watch. Hey, It's Tarantino, gotta see tarantino, whatever.
</p>

<p>
First of all, that I gotta point out is that this movie seems to focus a bit into, well, showing how the director saw the past, years when film I guess was still being developed as an industry back in the days. Which was shown as a very nice past, where many wanted to excel and do well and were a bit careless here, a bit chill there. America of the, I don't know, what years was this in? Well, anyway, there is the unique Tarantino dynamics associated with this movie, although a bit brought down altogether. It gets violent by the end of it but the general peak kinda feels overall lesser compared to his other movies that really involved swimming through violence and often also gore. I mean, each to their own, I didn't quite mind this shift. I liked the depiction of California, the leading cast performed top-notch, I mean what else could you expect from titans like Di Caprio or Pitt. Especially, when they're kind of playing something they may be more familiar overall with, you know? It's a nice movie to see. Enjoyable. And that's kind of it.
</p>

<p>
I'd say this is more of a 7/10 but you know, I'm feeling generous today and I can't say this movie really had lows overall. At least the acting should get some props from me, as I like all the subliminal details that were acted out, which made the entire experience much nicer to kept yourself engaged in. Oh, also there is the immersion element to it. Definitely an immersive movie, mhm.

  <center><h4>Toy Story 4</h4></center>

  <p>
For this one I was going into the cinema believing that this is going to be a hit of a magnitude that Toy Story 1 was. I mean, going into the past! I mean, the advertisements really lured me in with the leading cast (which deterred me from seeing it in with a non-English dub) and just the cut out parts that I felt, that, yeah, this is going to be a great movie. And, I mean, it is a good movie. Except, that there is this thing that it wasn't, that's what I believe at least, it wasn't as overall emotional as at least some of the predecessors were or what I would except from a triple A animation to depict.
</p>

<p>
There is not much to say apart from this. It's a bit a dip into the past, the movies of your childhood. I just got to see a lecture, co-creator of Pixar at University of Sydney and he talked a bit about how all the years led to the creation of Toy Story and how moore's law generally contributed to them being eventually able to make this reality. Toy Story 4 isn't such a revolution, you know? It's a story. Generally, kind of captivating story that kind of connects more with parents, who see how their children eventually deter away to, I don't know, like, childhood I guess? Just that it less involves them, so it hurts and so it is conveyed with toys in Toy Story 4. But, ya know. An animation should contain more. Cause I'd risk stating that it is all about conveyance of emotions, why else exaggerate everything?
</p>

<p>
It's still a good movie and I'd recommend going to it with a kid if you have one. Otherwise, you know, it's a good movie but just don't expect it to carry god knows what. It's a continuation that just prolongs a well established series, that's all.

  <center><h4>Kick-Ass 2</h4></center>

  <p>
Man, I don't even know if I should cover this one. Every now and then you end up watching a movie that, I mean, there's nothing bad about watching it. Except that it doesn't necessarily need a review. Here we have Kick-Ass, sequel of it. I mean the original was kinda fun to watch, concentrating on someone who decided to become a superhero, cause why not. The sequel kinda, well, continues this. And it extends in some ways but overall feels a bit trite and lacking, well, much in everything. But, you know, it's enjoyable so I'll just leave it at that.

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
