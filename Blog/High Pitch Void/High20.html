    	Sometimes when I see something I can somehow discern outright that something will become out of this particular thing.

      It's not always the case and cases turn and shift and move around and eventually not much always does come out.

      It's not often that I decide to put something high up in the sky of what I believe is the best.

      It's even rarer for me to find something that I consider it to be the best in so many levels, even if the reason is rather subjective.

  <p>
BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER
    </p>

    <p>
      THERE WILL BE SPOILERS
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll try to keep them to a minimum but it's hard to talk about the details of this movie to an extent that I really want to convey why I put it so high in my regards without speaking of what this movie actually consisted of.
    </p>

    <p>
      But just be warned.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have the time and the opportunity, the movie is being streamed on Disney+. To me, a month's worth of subscription, the price it goes for - is very easily justified for this very movie alone. Not to mention, apparently there's tons other stuff that is likely worth catching your eye, lots of Pixar, lots of Disney, lots of really great quality stuff, also the classics and the very old classy classics even. But from all this, I had a really deep dwell on this. As deep as I could go as of recent, because there are movies or other cultural phenomena or even situations in life, when you've experienced them but they didn't exactly get you to the extent that you believe they probably should have and that having said, you completely get that they totally did. It just, the extent of it, surpassed what you were able to recept.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's pretty much how I felt about this movie, although the extent is bit hard to assign here, considering how the movie operates on subtleties, nuances and references so agilely that you begin to wonder what have I missed. At least I have, despite having fished out so much from all this.

	  <center><h4>Before I hit the surface</h4></center>

  <p>
  	Just to give a bit of an overview how I approached this movie. I came across some promotional materials months prior and I thought that, yeah, that movie's going to be good. Not necessarily something absolutely mind-breaking but definitely good, even very good and I knew this even without delving deep into who's making it or whatever the bonanza. I'm not even entirely sure I knew it was Pixar who was making it, despite the style was, well, defintiely pixar. Not the director. I might have come across who was working on the soundtrack, though. But still I was relatively fresh and there was another Pixar movie that came out this year, that I also saw some promotional material and didn't feel it was at the very, very as much promising level as I felt Soul was. The thing was, that I didn't really know what Soul exactly was, except that it revolved around the concept. How would it tread, what would be touched, obviously could have some ideas but exactly what, couldn't tell.
</p>

<p>
  And the expectations should grow, considering that I have gone through almost all of Pixar and Disney shorts, have come through a part of an Animation (and Visualisation) academic (practical) course and watched tons of shorts and feature animation after leaving it and I believe I have seen some really stellar and amazing pieces this year alone and there has been really, tons. So much that it could make my head spin, all the way from absolute classic Disney animations to all of Ghibli stuff that I have not seen before and more, much much more.
</p>

<p>
  I have also seen a lot of classic movies. The ones in Black and White, like Chaplin's classics. Or some extremely gritty ones, like La Haine or quite historical like Come and See. Despite the volume, there wasn't a massive deal of movies that I could say they're 10/10 and that stole my heart, in the end there were some very particular reasons I could rate a movie so highly and they were roughly the following:
</p>

<p>
  - Due to being aesthetically something I have not quite yet experienced which mesmerised me to the very core<br>
  - Due to having a tremendous value, whether historical or specific theme revolving around that had it executed particularly exceptionally<br>
  - Being an all-rounder that is uniquely exemplary compared to anything out there with some qualities that exceed overwhelming most
</p>

<p>
  But there is also a very specific quality, that in addition to this, or even without all this, just simply steals my heart. And it's a rather very simple quality really, that is just so hard to execute
</p>

<p>
  - Having an element, a twist or something that ultimately completely surprised me, particularly of emotional nature but could be also technical that I just saw and got my jaw dropped
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, this movie pitched into every single one of those requirements, I could argue whether more or less, because usually I'd give a 10/10 just purely based on one of those, as there would be a massive pressure put on a specific quality in a specific production. But I'd argue this one still made it all across and got me with an additional cherry on top, which I usually put aside, since I don't really believe in having something like this sway me one way or another, because it suddenly feels as if I'm being too subjective, even being swayed by such futile minor things as those little things that one probably just calls as - an emotional connection. But one that basically, I could really, really relate to. But there're additional layers of depth to this and in this particular case, I can make this slide, one exception, just because of those extra layers. I don't konow. It's as if this movie was made particularly for me but I know it isn't. It's for all of the people all over the world. I truly belive there is great significance in it but due to how it all was arranged, I could really particularly relate.

  <center><h4>Boarding and Riding the Surface</h4></center>

  <p>
On the surface, once I made my descent and got my hands on the thing, I kicked it off. And it didn't dazzle me outright. There are productions that did pretty much the same, didn't punch you outright but eventually somehow got me, sometimes halfway through already, sometimes right at the end inverting the entire thing upside down and making me go, holy woa how. But still this one kicked off peculiarly.
</p>

<p>
  I mean, the usual Disney, Pixar logos with an accompaniament of.. particularly, eye piercing arrangement of jazz-like audition. Now, that already got something in my head thinking, I'm gonna delve a layer or two deeper. To think for a second, how do you actually even approach or begin to approach recording a badly played jazz audition, like as if it's being played at a school and most of the kids can't even play the damn instruments right. How do you... make this right? I mean professional musicians are usually trained to play professionally, right but there's another thing that Jazz, as many things out there which is considered art, is flavoured by lots of things, how people normally are, behave, what emotions they feel while they play... and hey, you're being tasked with getting together with other musicians to play something that is just pure scramble. And not just that but it eventually sort of shifts, evolves into a piece of subtleties that eventually slides in with a hint of genius, which is all in paar with exactly what the creators most likely wanted to convey, with a single person who kind of out of boredom just steps up and goes solo and plays something that maybe isn't genius but has a shine, kind of obfuscated but there and the teacher recognises it but the class scoffs the attempt.
</p>

<p>
  This is the first literal minute or two of the movie that just happened. It's not something that I got outright exactly right there, I kind of had to repeat the scene a few times to also adjust myself, to the light conditions in my room and get the level of sound right in my headphones and all. But I found myself repeating lots of scenes for the pure satisfaction but also what I saw and what I missed. And there's already a lot going on and there's much more that does afterwards, in the next minutes, tens of minutes, half an hour, hour and the rest.
</p>

<p>
  The surface is still already beautiful as is. The setting, the characters, the Pixar Renderman shading. The style. The voice acting. The writing. The soundtrack. The camerawork. The post-processing. The variety of it all and then how it all synergetically becomes something even better but even on its own, there's still more than meets the eye much more. And let's try to skip lots of me just drawing upon what I've seen with my bare eye and go a bit through all this.

<center><h4>Digging Deeper but not too deep yet</h4></center>

    <p>
Oftentimes one of the first thing for me to criticise is the writing. There's lot of stuff that can go wrong and I can fish out. Being written to plainly. Characters being too much of archetypes. Being to l... whatever, many things can always go wrong and it's not necesasrily easy to write something anyway, here I go, launching salvos of words right at ya. But in the end I think it all comes down to just, how much you are able to convey and what are you conveying. The answers can be simple or totally anything something else and beyond. And this movie kind of has a little bit of all that but. I'd argue it manages to get everything right.
  </p>

  <p>
    The characters are fantastically written. The words they utilise, the way they communicate, what they communicate and the entire screenplay and what happens when and how, 99.9% of the time I couldn't utter a word against it, especially with just how much content there was packed in it. One minor thing against I could have had, was maybe how the guy got a name mixed-up as a professor. And I think that was the most far-fetched thing I saw in the writing. Pretty darn impressive, am I right? But writing's kind of nothing without the right performances. Your head can be a good one, hence books are so good. But damn, the combo of the leading performances was so stellar that I could hardly see it being improved in any way feasible. The amount of emotion and detail and polish and how it went hand in hand with the subtleties being portrayed in the movie. And then.. from the technical side, how at some point in the movie, different voices are used for the characters we have already known and... how well it all worked. Wowza.
  </p>

  <p>
    And there were plenty of experimentation that was happening in here. Different animation styles. Some shots early in the movie I had some objections to, particularly to how lit it was and how kind of without life it felt (maybe that was the point?). But there was some exemplary things happening, with the mix of 2D animation styles, VFX and comp blends, shading of which some stuff was absolutely taken me to knees in terms of how exactly was that achieved and lots just lots of fantastically arranged things happening throughout and just the sheer detail of work that went into designing everything in the movie. It's not quite spiderverse level I suppose but still maybe in some formulas cutting it somehow close..? Maybe? Some scenes absolutely were a marvel in terms of FX. But that wasn't the focus most of the time I've been gazed deep into the movie.
  </p>

  <p>
    That having said, I already touched upon how the movie consisted of different things in it and that goes also for... music. Let alone experimentation with the format, that it didn't necessarily experiment absolutely, as the movie did feel as if it kind of dropped a bit on all the subtleties game halfway through, as it still sort of had to adhere to the format of a movie and narration and stuff just so that it keeps the audience engaged and retain coherence and perhaps this is not something that I would have absolutely liked, it's nit-picking, as it was still delivered well and despite this, still managed to finish in a style that just simply continued and managed to surprise me. Which considering the sort of movie this is, still is on its own, surprising and very positive surprise it was.

  <center><h4>Deeper now</h4></center>

  <p>
But again, what was this movie about now? Soul. Something etheral. A concept that, heh, well, so many cultures define so different I suppose. Difficult to grasp, don't you think? I mean, the narration could impose just one thing and it sort of does now that I think about it but being as open-ended to think about, I guess one can't pack it in just a simple one-way package.
</p>

<p>
  Think about a journey to a barber. And how someone in your shoes could talk completely differently to the barber. And ask him about life. Why he's a barber. Perhaps he's happy. Perhaps he's not. Perhaps he wanted to do something else in life. But ultimately things out of his control got him to do this. And he's exceptional at this. As if he's got a soul to do this. And you know this. But you wouldn't ever know why he does this because maybe you'd rather talk about your own things. You're the client. You're the boss. You get what you want. But perhaps with a little effort you'll get to know more. For instance why does the barber do what he does. What he loves about this job. Perhaps he loves doing it because he gets to talk to so many different people and hear their stories like yourself. The client on his chair. See this is just one minute or two of the movie. And there's even more going on in such scene and in more scenes that precede and overtake it. It all just kind of talks about who we are, why we do what we do, what we're striving to do, how badly we're trying and where does this ultimately take us. What's important in life? How do you live a life and how do you see all the forms of how it's being lived? Do you see everything in your life the way it is or perhaps something obfuscates the view that you don't see, perhaps there's something that you'd love to strive for that you failed to discern.
</p>

<p>
  What is it that defines what are you.
</p>

<p>
  What is it that you want to become.
</p>

<p>
  This movie broaches so many branches of the same tree it's hanging on and it's doing so well to make you think about life and the life you're leading and the rest of your life of how you'd be living. And regardless of this, it still manages to make you laugh and get you nostalgic and sad and get lots of other emotions in play. The classic pixar stuff that they're so good at. But under all of this not quite, exactly out there plain in hiding, all those, I feel not as often, not as deep and not as greatly broached topics that I believe are the epithome of art, all the important questions and not necessarily imposing ideas or values of your own and yet not keeping it all so etheral and washed out at all, providing lots of interpretations and ideas and guides and... something yet very complete to think about.

<p>
  And so much that I personally have to think about. So much that I am personally thinking and have been personally thinking and so many people out there are personally thinking.
</p>

<p>
  Whether they're having a mid-life crisis or a quarter-life crisis. Or they're just simply kids or teenagers or older people or whoever, all across the spectrum. There is lots, all over and much of it unbelieveably greatly covered. But in regards to myself, so much to think about.
</p>

<p>
  Who do I want to become? Who am I? What's happening in my life? Where am I going? Was lots of my life a mistake? Could I have corrected those mistakes if I went back in time? I'm not good enough I want to become better. I'm afraid of what will happen in life. What's going to happen tomorrow where I'll end up in 10 years. The anxieties, the obsessions, the intricacies of life. The unknowingness of what the future will bring. Of all the stuff that is important and isn't. That life goes by and I'm an individual. That there are other people in life and the importance of a community. The life is worth living but what is it living for? And suddenly everything is in the movie that provides examples of the anxieties and the responses to those anxieties. A gateway for the future and lots of stuff that you can just finish the way that you believe or could be as you believe.
</p>

<p>
  What am I striving for? Where am I going? How far can I go, am I not obsessing too much about what I am doing? About other people? About feeling helpless or lost? Am I driving too deep into a downward spiral? What's out there else, perhaps I'm aiming not exactly what I should be aiming at and for? What am I missing? Is this the life I want to be living? Is there a better life? Am I caring about all the other lives or perhaps just myself? Am I doing something wrong in all this thought-process? How are other people managing? How are other people living their lives?
</p>

<p>
  Suddenly, all those intricacies and the major labirynth of what the world and all the lifely things are become bit less oblique once you see the movie. And all the intricacies are all sort of interwoven and interchangable, like Jazz and how it sort of corresponds to how just life is. How how well, how badly it can be played and how beautifully shift and all of the everything that it imbues.
</p>

<p>
  It's remarkable really, just the sheer spread of what the movie contains and how it manages to just do so well all-across the spectrum.

    <center><h4>One More Layer</h4></center>

<p>
  This layer, is a bit reserved to myself and my own subjective view and knowledge. But I have a feeling that lots of it was sort of intended.
</p>

<p>
  Pizza. You're going to be thinking, fuck you Fuad, what does Pizza have to do with all this? I'm going to tell you what. But you may not quite understand the full extent of what I mean. There is a scene in the movie in which a soul becomes absolutely petrified, bewildered by the world surrounding. And It's New York. It's fast-paced. Lots of things happening all around you all the time, crazy, absolutely crazy, beyond clockword just absolutely bonkers but it's just the fast-paced part they're pretty much showcasing yet. And another soul needs this petrified soul to help him so to entice it to see why it's worth living, the obvious choice is... food. And the choice of a New York pizza is like no other, with the New York Pizza having a taste exceeding what you'd get in Italy itself, with the crust striking the perfect balance of crunchiness and mass texture, the flavour, the pleasure... mm... what a reference, one that only a New Yorker could get. And I have been to New York. I lived there for 4 months. And what a reference that was, my my.
</p>

<p>
  Not the only one from New York, as the portrayal of contemporary New York was so good. How people excel at what they do. Jazz Player. Barber. Fabric. Everything. And the vibrance and variety of all the people there, they got it so right. So well and swell. It got the feel of New York in the movie. Just the right extent for this particular movie. But my god, all those details, oh, how I could connect with all them.
</p>

<p>
  And then there's the music. Sure, I think I already talk about Jazz and how it all beautifully shifted and transited in between the music itself, animation, voice acting and everything really, one big synergy. But there's the other part of the music, the score and that's the one created by Trent Reznor and Atticuss Ross. A fairly recent discovery in the movie business. And Trent Reznor I have known for more than, well, more than 10 years of my life, with Nine Inch Nails being my favourite band of all time. This duo got quite some nominations and even oscars for their score, despite they rather go around in a specific electronic tones. But they're craftsmen and definitely Trent is one, like with the laboratory of everything to produce music they have. And the end result of their music going hand in hand with the world.
</p>

<p>
  But that's not all. There's a deeper layer. And that's what Nine Inch Nails was. And there was lots of lost souls in them. And lots pertaining to some very heavy and lifely themes. And this all sort of shifted throughout Reznor's career and music changed as he changed. In the end, nowadays he's a very successful musician reaping oscars even. Back then, starting from Industrial Metal, very angry music, very even trashy music, Woodstock concerts and lots of stuff that was poured into his music, that had a profound emotional baggage and in many ways resonated with me back in the days when I started listening to it. I didn't like it straightaway but it grew on me. And you know, Soul's score also grew on me. But I found it intricately sublime to choose Trent Reznor with Atticus, to do the part of the movie's OST. Such an excellent choice, considering the movie itself, on its own, with its themes and everything and to put the additional layer of variety also to the music section of Soul.
</p>

<p>
  Wow.
</p>

<p>
  So many levels this movie resonated with me.
</p>

<p>
  It's been technically days and I'm still thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
  Just because they... just covered such keys I just so much in life care.
</p>

<p>
  I can't be 100% sure before I rewatch the movie but I just feel like savouring it and...
</p>

<p>
  I hope it just indirectly or directly even just simply helps me in finding that spark it so much revolved.
</p>

<p>
  In the end it performed a top of the game diagnosis, now the question is in regards to how it should progress further
</p>

<p>
  That's something the movie can't exactly tell anyone but it gave some good pointers in regards to just how it could potentially become

    <center><h4>Kids on the Slope & Terror in Resonance</h4></center>
    
    <p>I wanted to see a bit more work of Mr. Watanabe, the mastermind behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Two shows came across as particularly interesting and I decided to roll in and binge through each. I'll start by giving an overview of Kinds on The Slope, a show I... did not eventually come a fan of.</p>

    <p>I'll provide a brief explanation: It was just a regular drama, close to being a soap opera. I can value productions which have quite interesting themes imbued but the joker here with jazz, didn't take the cue at the forefront. The best parallel to establish here is Your Lie in April, a show very close in case of the showcased themes, except for jazz you had piano and violin, and classical music. The depth came close, although Your Lie was more heartfelt and deeper in terms of how it tangles emotions. In the end, there was a similar propotion of adolescent love themes portrayed, cliched and overused in a number of contemporary productions. All in all, everything has been said and told, portrayed and conveyed. I expected more from Shinichirô Watanabe. But as a show it felt complete and had an interesting span of life involved. Let me quickly note, this is not a bad show. But I don't think I'm a target audience for this anymore. If you're after some not too demanding drama with a solid hint of more refined musical themes, this could be something for you.</p>
    <p><center>6/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Terror in Resonance was something else, though. It doesn't start perhaps on the best page but it unravels nicely with a good portion of action. I became dissapointed with how it advanced and the involvement of as I'd call supercharacters and some lacking of themes of particular depth. But the execution felt good, the soundtrack was stellar and the presentation was phenomenal, entailing the cartoon itself and the especially the color-grading. It was a notch cliched but the characters were well defined and in the end I really enjoyed watching it, all in all. It might be a spoiler but if you enjoyed Fight Club and what the plot of it entailed, you could treat Terror in Resonance as a quite interesting extension as it builds upon some of it. In the end, a show which I'd consider to be far from dissapointing but it didn't really excel at the same time.</p>

    <center><h4>Incredibles 2 & Antman and the Wasp</h4></center>
    
    <p>I had the opportunity to travel quite recently. I found some good cheap tickets to Europe but I did not expect to get any entertainment as these were the cheapest tickets I'm probably ever going to get in my lifetime, moving me halfway across the world. At times, good fortune comes and in this particular case, a charter flight managed by Singapore airlines came as a replacement for Scoot from Sydney to Singapore and vice versa. That, surprisingly, meant in-flight entertainment, food and... well, entertainment! Usually there are quite new movies involved and so I decided to take a look at what they had onboard and so I did.</p>

    <p>Incredibles 2, a continuation from the original released.. oh my, when was it released? I must have been in secondary or even primary school at the time and if I recall well, I liked it, even the game they released, it was quite fun. The continuation strikes the viewer with... the animation and characterisation both of which are executed in a very... down-to-earth and real feel, as if it is a typical American family in its... well... advanced age. Here confined in the superhero realm, all blended nicely. What I also liked about it was how they merged the classic and the new. The cast was a bit funny, a bit as if I was watching animated Better Call Saul but I got used to it. The voiceovers were executed professionally, in fact the movie was executed professionally and provided the viewer with joy. Is there anything else that a good animation movie should do? Well, perhaps introduce some cool contents to relate to and it does this too, as this movie is probably about family as a whole. And that is actually cool.</p>

    <p><center>8/10</center></p><br>

    <p>Ant-Man and the Wasp is a complete different spectrum. The performance was rather bland, the dialogues bad most of the time. The world too confined and storyline often naiive. A blockbuster that just doesn't watches too well. Combat was nicely defined. Antagonists turned out quite pale. In short, nothing to see here.</p>

    <center><h4>Another Day of Life</h4></center>
    
    <p>I do this at times, that I show up in the country I grew up in and take a look at something that I kept my eye on for an insurmountable time. That is peculiar wording but hey, there was no other way of seeing this unless I popped up back in Poland and... based on the promotional materials I've seen, I didn't believe it would turn out really good. I know Platige Image as a professional studio that gained on recognition over the years. If I received an offer to work there even as an intern, I wouldn't think twice of moving back. But at times, their production can become a bit... too exaggerated. And that's what it felt based on what I've seen. Once I popped up at a local cinema in Warsaw, oh yes I love these smaller joints, surprisingly well maintained and the feel of... oh wow, what's that feel, how do I frame it. It's a bit fastbackward to the communist times, except it didn't feel as such, just a good, really nice cafe with a cinema embedded into it. But hey, I'm here to talk about the movie, ain't I?</p>

    <p>What it does depict, is a war-torned Angola. With a polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuściński. Very interesting character based on what I've read, a person who lived and breathed with war but primarily to showcase what is happening instead of actively participating in it. In the movie, he's showcased in just that way, although the impartiality is dissolved a notch. I was watching the movie with polish dub which held up quite well, although I would have liked to see how it turned out in English. All of a sudden, problems became apparent with how the movie's flow would become numerously disturbed with shots taken in the contemporary times, showcasing the point of view of characters depicted in the movie who are still alive to this day. At first, this was a bit unforgiveable. But as the course of the movie went by, it became tolerable and even understandable.</p>

    <p>In the end, it wasn't exactly what the movie has shown what took the centerplace, although it probably should. Despite there was a bit of glorifying the eastern block and communist and resistance forces there was a bit of interesting discussion going on, geopolitical themes implemented and just how people, cities, soldiers behave in times of social unrest and civil war. The dialogues were good and the deeper sequences thought-provoking. But what this movie truly shined out with was the animation and the exaggerated, surreal sequences. Artistically, this is yet another stellar work performed by the Polish. Absolute top-grade work that I would love to be able to conduct myself. Regardless, my worries associated with the averagely enticing trailers in the end did not deliver the dissapointment. I left the movie satisfied, although with a bit of conflicting thoughts scouring my mind. There were a lot of parties involved in the creation of this movie too, I guess there is a specific importance associated with the movie as war correspondents don't get too much of the spotlight they diserve too often.</p>
