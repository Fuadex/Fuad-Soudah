<p>
Some imagine an idyllic world, one in which they don't have to do anything. Things come to them as they please and things happen to happen, regardless of whatever effort they.. Whoa, wait a minute. Now this idyllic world is mutating, something's wrong, ain't there?

  <center><h4>Longstanding</h4></center>
    
<p>So here's the thing. I haven't been doing much in the last, in fact couple of weeks. It's not necessarily bad to do nothing for a while, as long as this while doesn't exceed a certain amount of time. In my case, I could assume that was over 2 months, which would have been generally fine for vacation during my school years but not in my 20s. The other fact that meddles with this portrait is, that I in fact, did quite a bit during my vacation. I did at least two trips around Europe and add the one that brought me back to Europe, which was about a week as well. The first three weeks was spent hanging around with friends and predominantly drinking. Not bad, except for the latter.</p>

<p>
But preceding the trip that brought me to Europe, I would also actually drink for about 2 weeks at the closing the semester graduation shows etc. So it all adds up and even during my trip, in Canada, I actually ended up on a night out. Which is fine as well. It's just, somehow my extremely overloaded lifestyle drizzled and flooded with alcohol and not knowing as to 'what next' led me to a very un-, well, rowdy routine. I especially hated the fact that I could not really communicate to the level I would have loved to and exchange ideas, stories with friends. Most of the conversations I would be at the very least semi-engaged with made me realize, how much I just did not know and how left behind I kinda keep myself by leading a lifestyle, which could be summed up partially as (semi-)locked up. There is not much that I can do to imagine my life in a prison but I would expect a lot of similarities between my current lifestyle and the one that I would probably expect to see institutionalized.
</p>

<p>
As I continue to be enclosed in these four walls, an hour away from Warsaw's centre, I'm slowly going mad. Just as fast and slow, and similarly to how I would behave in Australia. To some degree, even New York, although that one became fruitful as many negative stimuli I was exposed to were not there. Although some other forms did. And the rule for me arriving to where I'd need to - about an hour and more, stuck to this city too. The only other city it did not, was really Munich but that was another utopian evil I'm still drowning in.

    <p> 
    But put it this way, where you are being funded from different sides and get set in a specific environment but there is paradoxically not too much to do otherwise. I mean, you could, except you really get tired of the 2 hours wasted per day and not even coming back intoxicated works the way you'd expect it to alleviate the symptoms. At some point also, people start to vanish into their daily routines and some others who lack them, properly incorporated into their lives, start meddling with yours, in this case mine and as I'm already experienced with not having good things come from such instances, I remain by my devices and prefer for people to keep away from my raw core and around. This extends onto other parts of my life, I prefer to take control over myself and therefore, to wash my own clothes, to do my own groceries and prepare my own food, rather than coming out of my room, running downstairs and seeing it's already prepared on the table. And it's the food I know from my childhood, what else. Although, compared to the time I was eating the food, today I know, that it is not necessarily good for me and healthy overall, which I could rebuke to my grandma but this is not the type of things you'd rebuke to your grandparents.</p>

<p>
This is all nice and all but it does take away control over my life and destabilizes how and what I do and think. Having everyone and everything so far away introduces more problems as I am not willing to burst this bubble on a daily basis. Ever since my bicycle was stolen from Munich, I do not have the flexible means of transport to get anywhere I please and I would have nothing against even commuting to Warsaw by bike, despite it is even tens of kilometres away. Except, I know I won't remain in this city for long and therefore, not willing to buy a brand new bicycle or resort to the ones the family has in possession but are not necessarily in operation.
</p>

<p>
It is what it is but there are other elements. Like not having access to a stable and fast internet connection. I'd have to deal with this in many parts of the world to some degree but not as severe as here. Limited bandwidth, not always stable and metered. I usually require larger amounts of data to juggle with due to my design work and the data I generate but here I cannot deal with all this, which puts a lot of my intention to work to an overly unsatisfying halt.

<p>
Some people also deem that memories are especially crucial for how we behave in certain situations, which also depends on the place the situation takes place, or rather as a form of a situationist taking action, as it is a specific form of a situation. Being around does bring back a lot of pleasant memories. But also tons of those bland and the ones that simply keep me demotivated to even walk outside the house. That's overall just sad and I do know a lot of the reasons behind this case, which extends onto other parts of my life and my behaviour. It is manageable and I know how to remedy this, except when a special formula kicks in and my head starts to work differently to how I'd expect it to.

      Suddenly, I start not remembering a lot.<br>
Some form of Alzheimer.<br>
Or Amnesia if you'd call it.
</p>

<p>
You forget words.<br>
You forget behaviour.<br>
You rollback to how you were.
</p>

<p>
It's a bit of a glass prison, being aware of being in one. But with the addition of a Stockholm syndrome, I really don't feel like going away and leaving all this. As there is a lot of pleasant memories associated with all, this. But as many of the places I have been to and that left some form of scars that I keep rewinding, I see the toxicity and what worries me further is that I am just merely moving to yet another form of toxic, although this time, without really knowing how toxic it will be and not seeing the clear chance of me getting out of this world of enclosure and keeping myself, which I still keep seeing as the only logical way of dealing currently with this world but still, moving between the known and the other known but a bit less toxicity that I am even less willing to go to.
</p>

<p>
And somehow this entire confusion makes me feel... Really sad... Just really sad...
</p>

<p>
Especially, there is no help on the horizon and when I rewind back and compare this to the lives others carry on with and out, I just realize how much I lack to be on the level I yearned for, worked tirelessly and should be ultimately on.
</p>
<p>
But am not.</p>

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>
