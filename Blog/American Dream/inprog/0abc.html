      One of my professors elicited a very interesting notion, even more interesting who that professor was, where I got to study his experiences and just how far back it reflects to. As he worked for Samsung on, what my memory would pinch me is something in relation to microcontrollers and stuff that made a specific series of phones run, as superior compared to anything else on the market. But as the professor's career bolted, he decided to go on his own, eventually making his way all the way to getting his company to an IPO. But at some point, as he remarked, he noticed how difficult things would get by just not having access to specific people who were right at the company he used to work at.

    <br>

    <p>
      Over the course of past weeks back I have been noticing a bit of, well, too much honestly. Going back in memories to think of what I would think once I'd pop up in what would just seem as slightly, probably bareably less or nothing of crazy place, I used to grow up in and or study. And now that I eventually did make my way all the way here I can safely assess. New York was very much unique in terms of how I was living. I mean, practically it was all me living and in this regards I guess I was acting just as I would act. But because of the massive load I had to carry from day to day and the sleepless nights and the city itself, sometimes I was wondering in regards to my own consciousness and how I am really managing. People do get breakdowns there, it's just that much intense. I had something a little different - a meltdown, 4 weeks on as my head went scorching and up in smoke. Thankfully, these were 16 weeks of intense work, so despite how worse it was getting I still managed to recover in ways and resteer my entire system to battle up with the amaze of wonder and glory sprawling down my footsteps, pedalling through on a steel-framed heavy bike, dodging what would potentially cost as thousand of bucks worth collisions through the straightforward maze of lower Manhattan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I'm back. And I can tell you, a form of adverse culture shock is hitting me here like nowhere before. I feel I understand more, at the very slightest. But there is no way I can fully express all that and in a conceiveable way for others really to comprehend, at times at any degree. I am concerned, though. The problem I usually had with Warsaw was that every single time I was back I was seeing it in so many different colours. Many of them were splendidly great, which went beyond what would locals say about what I was seeing. Perception can be very deceiving. But after having seen a bit and after having not returned to one place for about a year, you start seeing things that seemed as normal. But they are not in any single bit. Let's carry out the critical dillema.

    <p>
      My mom is a very interesting person. Scratch that. She is a person. A person, who as a mom, can but doesn't necessarily have to be concerned about their kid. I guess a totally normal thing to be as a parent. But I as a son, perhaps have yearned for stepping out of this overprotective scheme for too long. For so long, that seeing my father not saying a word on skype for months and my mother sending messages in crippled polish or links to stuff I don't need or never asked for or religious texts, as usual, reminds me of why I decided to leave this place at a place in time, managing to accomplish quite a lot academically the least. This picture does unfortunately extend, as despite my father would not perhaps particularly keep in touch all the time as my mother would usually want to, they both are extremely self-centered by their try for empathy and trying to make their child happy for no reason at all. The problem is, though. That in the end, when I look all the way back, all this was probably the least that I needed and as I keep venturing through the educational spheres in life, I just see how somehow their isolative ways of life just made them both live a life that is of their own, very often twisted imaginations. It's just the illusions they keep themselves to, is what I have a problem with and I see how all that extended onto me, primarily in a negative sense.
    </p>

      It truly works on my nerves, when I keep hearing specific things like: 'and what, it's good eh?', when they express their feelings, literally overstepping their, my boundaries and imposing on how I should feel about the food they've prepared. 'Yerba mate????', when they see me walking to heat up a batch of water, for, well, my matero, after which they will briefly rebuke about mate, that perhaps they want some too. That it's probably good, that they gotta buy the one I bought because it probably is good. They'll offer it to guests, they'll keep bugging me, warning me to drink less strong batches. Then I'll walk past my grandparent's place and hearing him listen to the radio, one particular frequency, literally, where they keep saying prayers, over and over and over and over. It could be anything else instead, Imams, Presidents, I don't have anything against religion of anyone wants to believe in something but I do against strong zeal. Just keeping yourself, I don't know what even. I'd say I don't do that but except I do certainly in certain forms, doesn't mean I don't want to combat it all but they seem pretty fine in their own bubbles, which I feel serve more of a way of control and so harm. My mom popping up out of nowhere, dismaying stuff I say or recommend and only changing her mind when she hears the same good stuff coming from other people she values. Following the state tv (despite they do watch all different news channels actually later), in which the quality of news is clearly and substantially lacking in quality (this actually goes for most of what's being screened currently in Poland). I also have some reservations in relation to the quality of food that they buy, all the way to the methods of preparation, in fact at times total disregard to certain processes and how foods should be kept and preserved. But I think what was driving me crazy the most was just how they are trying to impose their ways of comprehension, especially in case of my mom's which often just is very, very twisted or just so screwing logic that it just really works bending wonders on my brains. I'm kind of surprised all the time, though. It's just chaos and in a way just as crazy everywhere, despite I am already out of New York. The chaos carries over in other forms, the way things are arranged, the way stuff just changes, your stuff without you ever knowing. Just this overprotective shit I am totally tired of and craziness, that I strongly point out at times but they don't care. It's just as bad for your environment as smoking, toxic definitely.

      Then there's the city itself. Where do I start. Well, I'll kick off with my favorite, safety barriers at my local railway crossing. It's kinda ok that there are for vehicles but just who the fuck came up with an idea to create one specifically for pedestrians before directly entering the platform. The path leading to it being really narrow already, which is also a bit defying logic and user experience. I mean, public infrastructure is supposed to be serving the people it is being built for, right? Then how is it that it is so badly designed, all the time, for practically most of the public works happening? And it doesn't even matter whether which government was actually in charge of all this. Pedestrian pathways are often too narrow. Which most of the time is not quite an issue at any of the other countries I have been to, pointing out here at Australia or the States, where a pavement are literally blocks of concrete set that often do not measure more than a meter wide. But there is almost nobody using them there and cyclists prefer using the streets, as these are suited for any sorts of tires. Here in Poland, I just come across cyclists speeding centimeters by you on a pavement which ain't longer than 1.5m wide, at times getting narrower or a bit wider depending on how the people living nearby decided to set their often bricked fences and gates. Here I gotta point out, I used to do the exact same when I was a teenager. But also there were many less people going back and forth at the time and the public infrastructure was frankly substantially lacking, especially for cyclists. So what did the geniuses do in the scope of past couple of years? Hell they did build pathways for cyclists, made out of bricks. Which is sort of ok for MTB bikes, especially once it's freshly made but after a year or two, these tend to crumble, shift a little... then it's much less of an experience to drive over those, especially for any sorts of bikes that actually have thinner tires. The alternative, though is to move on asphalt, which is often a good case to do but the streets often are quite narrow themselves with unpaved sides of the road. Leading to cases that if you do use the road to move around, you will often clog the traffic. I normally can maintain about 30 km/h of speed by bike but many will go as slow as pedestrians. If they decided to cycle on the pavement, people will get annoyed and it is unlawful to do so as well. But then there are many of the younger generation who prefer to ride on the pavements at some streets that are suited for cyclists, with a bit of traffic but also with frequent speed bumps. In such case cyclists can go faster than cars but nah, better take the pavement frequently attended by pedestrians, eh?

  This is even more annoying, as such 'pavements created for both pedestrians and cyclists' are useless for some other people. Now there scooters running around Warsaw, these guys are robust and are electrical so perhaps it is relatively okay to use those for sidewalks. But let's take a non-electrical type. There is really no pleasure in driving one around and needing to kick off every 5 seconds to keep your thing running. And then you have roller skates and roller blades, which will absolutely be utterly useless on paved walkways. These would be good or cyclepaths that are made out of asphalt or concrete or a mix between (from what I know, concrete is best all the way with the least friction). But that won't be the case if the cyclepaths are made out of bricks! I can see somepoint to getting such done in such manner, at least to well raise just a well, wider footpath. One that is at least 2.5 meters wide is suitable for cyclists and voila, due to the legislation, yes, cyclists can legally ride through and so they call it a pedestrian-cyclists footpath. It's just, I have been recently to Germany and despite some cities may seem a bit rundown like Berlin, from what I've seen so far, in most the cyclepaths are actually done properly. Asphalt. For most of the cases. If not, there will often be a seperate line on the street for cyclist to roam through. It's ofen made in a way to not become quite annoying for pedestrians too, as in the line will often go along the street or be positioned on an elevated level along the street so that cars can't go over it. The paths will also be constructed in a way that they will often just be straight. This sounds almost like a pleonasm here, I mean this is obvious that streets should go straight, right? Well, here in Poland, whenever an intersection I see too often cases where the the cyclepath will do a bit of a slight detour, making it impossible to pass an intersection just by going pure straight crossing the intersection. At times it is done so unnaturally, that you may think it's literally just an extension for cars, which it is obviously not. I also see now that there is some sort of other madness happening in Warsaw currently, where they put asphalt cyclepaths on larger swaths of pavements but they put it right in the middle of it all. Pedestrians have priority all of the time so even if a cyclist bumps into one, the cyclist ought to be liable but they often won't care as long as they're on it. This makes it bad for such pedestrians, as in these key points to which I'm pointing too are often attended by larger groups of people, let's say for coming on and off the tram, bus or the metro. In such case, the cyclepaths ought to be designed in a way that will not be bothersome for pedestrians but they cut through those key points nowadays. Another seperate case I see is one Park & Ride area, which they have revitilised (Aleja Wilanowska). There are a few huge problems with how they have done it. First of all, there is no direct connection for pedestrians from metro to the 'bus knot'. You need to pass through a street and often by a few parked cars in an unlawful way. Everyone does this. Not to mention there is a carpark positioned right in between the bus terminal and the subway. In addition, they have made an additional zebra crossing at the beginning of one lane at the terminal. One that is extremely frequently attended by buses which often leads to confusion between people and bus drivers alike, at times it will not be the first bus in line that will be departing but the second due to the buses not lining up properly, due to the crossing made at the beginning of it. Not to mention it is kinda dangerous for it to be there in the first place, take it anyone is driving it, they can't see anybody popping up all of a sudden. All this may sound abstract but it's all the bits and pieces, just who the fuck designs this city in the first place?
</p>

<p>
  I am also often a bit afraid of walking along the street to. I live by a street that does not have any pavements for pedestrians, the only way to move along it is by moving along the street but by remaining on the street. The streets are often narrow, all around Poland in fact, often allowing perhaps two cars to pass by simultaneously but it is not always the case. There are streets which even lack roadsides and the drivers often do not care, speeding often centimeters by you. I don't want to point out the lack of skills on the drivers' side but even the slightest mistake will lead to a fatal case. I felt much safer in, actually, every single country I've been to so far. Sure, you get crazy drivers in Australia but with the infrastructure being a bit Americanised in the suburbs, where the roads are ridiculously wide, you'd need to deliberately drive into someone to lead to an accident. All that just makes venturing from point A to B very bothersome. I don't mind walking kilometers to get somewhere (although I'm starting to feel eerie about the time I spend doing so) but if it's just not feeling okay for some reason to do so, I'm starting to have second thoughts. I think due to this back in the past I often leaned towards returning back home from a party by bike, whatever condition I was in. To feel much safer to travel back by this method than by foot, I feel, illustrates just how bad it is.

  Then there is the public transport about which I was feeling it was pretty actually good here in Warsaw. Modern, good fleet, quite regular services, affordable tickets (for students at least, all kind). Often there is wifi, now even usb hubs. You may buy tickets in a ticket machine within many of the buses. But once 35 degrees started hitting the entire country, somehow I ended up often in a bus, train, tram, even metro without proper AC. It was just extremely bad and now that I look back, I think in any country I've been to that experiences extreme weather, the AC just works well, say Sydney, Montreal, Munich. I'm surprised it's that bad here and the fleet that Warsaw has at its disposal, seems a bit rundown actually now. It hasn't been long since they have equipped themselves with all those brand new buses and they're at such state already? Wifi often does not work on trains. Also, AC doesn't either. There are quite frequent delays and some of the timetables are fucked, with no train arriving for a bit over an hour and then two arriving consecuitively one after the other by literally just a few minutes. The last train back to where I live seems to depart from Warsaw about at 11:30 PM. The tickets sold at the trains also do not seem to carry much sense, as it works in segments but there is no logic in them. At times, you may end up paying the same amount for slightly longer routes and they are priced in a weird way up to the cent, which makes it just a hassle for both customers and the conductor. Some ticket machines also work in a strange way. Some will not have the screen bright enough for you to buy a ticket in full-sun. Some will carry on with errors. Say you need 5 tickets, the ticket machine will often need 5-10 seconds to dispense a ticket each. I gotta say these systems are designed quite well but there are some areas where they just need improving. Payment usually is seamless, though. But they also introduced a few ways to pay, at times you will get a plastic ticket with which you may enter a metro only from one side, which is just simply not clear (especially where to put the ticket to get the QR scanned, not all people know what a QR code is). The newer gates established at the second line of metro look bad, as if already rundown and you cannot just walk quickly, pass through as the gates open lazilly. The realtime departure screens often are misleading, the public transport does seem to have some problems with arriving on time, although that's not necessarily bad compared to any other country in fact. The only problem is, that in any other country, the connections seem to arrive more often, which makes it less of a pain to travel around. I especially have much against the train connections, which are illogically constructed, do not come through often enough and stop running too early. Changing buses from my area is a pain as well.

    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      All in all, Warsaw seems to be constructed for cars primarilly, although it's not quite. As there is a hyperinflation of road signs. I'm not joking, there are so many. So so many, on one road you may come across about 50 in ridiculous cases. It is simply impossible to keep track of all, for drivers. If there were driverless cars running around, the system fueling it all would have to be so robust to take under consideration it all. But to calculate how to behave in which situation, I believe could lead to paradoxes where the cars, if I was an AI, I would probably just refuse to carry on. I swear, with such large swaths of signs, there must be contradictions in place. From what I recall, there are also cases where some solutions made for cars are also illogical, where you need to change lanes to keep going forward. The streets also seem to be too strongly curved, which makes it just at times even dangerous from drivers themselves to keep in lanes and not cross onto others going the same way. I feel there is also not sufficiently enough of over- and underpasses. There is a weird tendency to get the pedestrian traffic onto the streets, rather than hide them below or get them up. This leads to interesting paradoxes, where some underpasses became closed due to this policy. In some areas, pedestrians have to walk up a few stories and walk down so they can get to a train platform 'safely'. Many refuse to do so, crossing the traintracks straight, which I do not blame them for. Even in order to connect to trams or any other forms, they have to do so, which again makes it extremely hassling. In some cities they made it logical, for instance in Cracow where is it quite straightforward to move around as a pedestrian from key areas (although some connections seem weird and confusing). The connection between the only two metrolines in Poland (in Warsaw) are too narrow and there are no signs that I could spot that show that yeah, you may change right there. Some interchanges are just made without taking under consideration the people, hence, just badly designed. That goes for each, local and a bit more global solutions such as railways. All of a sudden, they seemed to have turned off all the ticket machines for in-country connections. And there are always queues that take at times tens of minutes to get what you need. Also, there are not enough train ticket machines for a specific type of suburban rail (koleje mazowieckie). The pricing scheme for rail is also a bit confusing, as it does not seem to take under consideration how many people have booked the train. Every single robust system that I know, seems to entice customers to make reservations early, the first tickets usually go at heavily discounted prices. You may get a ticket at long-distance trains at Deutsch Bahn for as low as 19 Euros but if you make the reservation with the train a bit more full, the price will skyrocket to over 100 Euros per connection. In Poland, the prices seem to be fixed, which is somewhat good for me, as students get 51% off. My situation is especially interesting, as I fall into the category, where 'a student who is taking his studies overseas, is under 26 and is a Polish citizen is eligible for student pricing'. I really wonder how the fuck did this line get in the state legislation, if it wasn't for some politician's son or daughter taking studies overseas and somehow making their lives easier. It kind of reminds me of these cases where the stench of corruption just seems a bit too much, where public offerings took only under consideration very specific types of whatever they were looking for, for which surprisingly only one type of whatever they were looking for (let's say cars) only fell into the category. Well, I get to take advantage of this so far but my main point lays elsewhere: the state train carrier does not seem to have a good pricing system. It seems to have started to change as at times you could get from point A to B at roughly the same time by taking a different type of train, with in theory a worse standard of service but in fact it was superior by at least having wifi onboard... which the premium service does not have. In which they serve a cup of tea... which is not necessarily a very good cup, with lots of rubbish that could be avoided (lots of plastic). It's just I see a lot of the shortsightness in all of the solutions being introduced around the country. It's not something particularly new, it's been like this for quite a while now also during the preceding governments. I just had a view of the country as being a bit more modern, compared to some other environments overseas. But there seem to be a lot of cracks in it.

      I'm also having a feel of chaos happening in terms of the services around Poland. Back in the days I was quite impressed by how the competition was fierce in terms of groceries, telecommunication etc. The prices generally were low and the quality of service very high. But that seemed to have ruptured. In case of groceries it is still the case but the prices have hiked quite substantially. You may buy really good quality products pretty much anywhere but it's a bit unclear to me how I manage to spend just simply too much and why such products tend to vary in case of prices substantially from one shop to the other. Some shops seemed to have gone a bit silent like the ladybird chain, as they made an attempt to target customers looking for a bit more premium range of products (so did many other chains). Many shops seemed to have rearranged a lot: their interiors, not necessarily becoming ultimately better, as in they have introduced a lot of clutter with the same types of products being offered at seperate alleys around the shop. Telecommunication websites seem cluttered, it really pains me to see prices depicted as let's say 69.99 instead of 70. When you see so many 9.99 everywhere, your head starts to ache. And the terms at times seem vague. I went to Liechtenstein once where roaming was supposed to cover the area. Once I crossed the border between Austria and Liechtenstein, suddenly my internet packages didn't seem to budge. I was left without any internet for the remainder of my trip and the next day I consulted the consultant, he said everything was done properly and according to the rules and that it's my device's fault for connecting to Switzerland (which is anywhere between 3-5 km away from Austrian and so Liechtenstein's borders). The consultant wasn't too nice about it but once I filed in a complaint, I did get it honored. Still, there is a lot of confusion going on in relation to whether I can do this or that and whether there are no landmines laid across the field, just so that you don't stumble into one and get yourself blown into the moon. It just seems as if a lot of the service providers seek to milk the customers as much as they, it feels worse than the states where the entire systems seems to be rigged to milk the citizens all the time, although they know exactly how much they will be milked for. This is not quite the case here in Poland. The element of uncertainty is just a bit too much, this unfortunately extends to enterpreneurs themselves, who get milked from the government at times for no reason. Service often takes a longer time compared to the west and is underwhelming, unfortunately.

      This all creates an unheathly circle social-wise. Creates walls, which actually entire communities also do. Gated communities, which remain open in many other for instance Netherlands, in Germany too. But here, every single developed cluster of homes seem to need an entire system to keep outsiders out. Perhaps it gets to do also something about how the infrastructure is constructed, as many local roads in, say Australia, kind of lead towards nowhere, serving just primarily the local needs of whoever needs to commute from the dead end. It worked a bit on my nerves while I lived in Aussie but I see the point quite clearly. I believe more roads around here ought to be closed from one end to serve only the local community and therefore try to pedestrianise the streets (open it up for cyclists too). There are not enough parks either. Lots of dust being generated by cars. Newly built pavements often have a lot of sand remaining after the development. Munich was an amazing city in terms of how the gigantic parks were beautifully interconnected with each other and put along rivers with large treets climbing up. These areas usually were just simply quiet, with lots of birds chirping and at times people passing by either by foot or bike. In Warsaw, it's just a mess. I miss also seeing large trees by the streets. Even New Yorks has those. At sleep during winter but blooming beautifully early summer. Keeping the temperature low, making each stroll a nice experience. Perhaps Warsaw still needs sometime to mature and see that having green areas and less concrete is the way to go.

      I also have some reservations in relation to the cuisine and quality of foods in general. I was surprised to see I can't find a good cup of coffee near the city center. It was all primarily chains, there is at least one really good with fantastic interior design but not necessarily good cup of coffee, though. New York was prevalently great all over with local chains serving fantastic coffee. Korea was amazing with local cafes. Montreal surprised me, even when I went into a very traditional place, where I was served a cup of coffee, I expected at best a neutral-tasting cup. And it was but somehow it had a bit of hazelutty notes and a bit citrusy finish. This was a good cup. I can't find any here. They sell a good roast quite close to where I live, which I should buy any day now but no cafe that I do know unfortunately. I went to try some Korean food, which didn't impress me with the service of sides and the flavour itself. I did manage to eat a fantastic burger. The food culture is certainly developing and catching up to the west with more and more interesting places coming into my radar but it's they all seem to lack here or there and come at a hefty at times price range. There often are exceptions, though. I find it often that locals are a bit more conscious in relation to what they do and eat and that's great to see.

      Now that is a big highlight for me, the people I am coming across quite often in my path here. I have a bit of problem with this, as for my first three weeks I have spent meeting with friends. When I do so, it's usually by a few beers. At times, there is more alcohol and that makes it a bit problematic for me to carry on from day to day. And I also seem a bit braindead but despite it all, the conversations I engage with or hear seem to be insightful, constructive and touch upon some really interesting topics. There is a lot of light shed from a variety of quite specialistic perspectives and I hear quite authentic and rich stories. Also just the pleasantness of many of the people I come across is really nice, in ways also the liveliness. I also see that in many cases, people who study here are just simply better in terms of the work they do compared to many of the western schools I have come across. At times, they are crazily good. I'll put a seperate post on this one day. I was extremely impressed by many of the works created by the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. With the concept, execution conducted flawlessly and so many different styles that I have seen in many cases.

      I also see now that I am here, that it's been pretty much 5 years now. And since then many people have moved on. Having kids, establishing families. Working, working. Carrying on with life. And I'm kinda in the middle of nowhere, pushing forward but somehow something somewhere, all missing and not quite making sense, putting me in a sense of a deep void from which I don't know where to move and head towards. Now this is not nice and frankly depressing which changes only when I start moving again or working meaningfully, which I often don't get to do.
