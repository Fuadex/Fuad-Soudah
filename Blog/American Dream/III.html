I'm laying inside, sleeping on the bed. Not sleeping, trying to sleep. I'm tired and yet not exactly, listening to the mild mild hum coming out in my window. Nobody's running around, nobody's driving around. It's 4:04 AM. Now the only part that feels vague, is the same hum, was as if, I was not actually there. Well, the bed feels nice, it's warm and cozy and I'd never feel like leaving. In fact, perhaps I would have not, it was a bit like a tomb, no light coming in, none going out. Unless I put the light on, if I got out of my bed. If I did, it would likely be due of my alarm or to put the light out. If I did that though, I would not see anything and do my very best to get myself back to bed, to sleep. Cause I had another long day the next day. Except, I don't necessarily, as I lay in bed but far far away from New York. The large metropolis but widespread, all the way down under near the central district of Sydney.

<p>Oh, I heard a car. Sydney being a coastal city but Minto was far from this. See, I lived in many cities but, near Warsaw it would be another kind of quiet. Unless my grandfather put the radio on with the infamous religious radio broadcaster getting through with their prayers or talks. Still, if anything, it would be quiet. Very quiet. With brief notes coming from the busier street out there, passing through, passing by, passing in and cutting through. Munich even more different, now real soundproof, unless there was a party going. Or someone coming back from one. Otherwise, just a yet another concrete block succumbed in a deep slumber. Well, unless it was summer. Then the deep slumbers would have their doors wide open, otherwise the slumbers would feel like saunas, ones in which you'd not end up feeling like sleeping. Just like me now, for a reason I don't quite understand. At the time, though? It was just too hot, too thick of air to breathe. And yet, I keep wondering how is it, that the outside of my window sounds so much exactly the same like it did in New York. Just outside, in Staten Island, as much soundproof, concrete walls I had but the same and I was exactly living in the coast. Now not but the mild mild hum, just waiting outside. No birds waking you up like in Poland they would. Not sunrays invading your life and pinkish red skies as if you were about to discover something bad. A horror movie of sorts and yet a paradise. Then, there's the other paradise that I am now. And a Dream that I was living. And none of which were of such and yet they were.</p>

<p>Staten Island was a very peculiar place to be. I didn't fit exactly. Nobody heard of it. You'd hear stories but none of it including Staten. Well just one, I heard from a guy that I saw exactly twice at the beginning and end at Parsons - that it's cheap and people are nice and still living like in the 80s. And it was exactly like it, like that. I'd walk fast back home, although without necessarily needing to do so. See, you'd hear stories. Oh, there was a shooting, something happened. Well, that'd be in Harlem, far far, 1.5h away. But see, there was stuff, there were things happening on Staten too. Still, it felt safe. But better keep safe than sorry, am I right? I mean I'd keep going back home and everything would be fine. And then sometimes a police car would be outside not that far. A couple of kids walking past, by. A grocery store a block away, where they wouldn't give receipts and the cashiers were Arabs. And where I'd buy a high calorie green tea, contemplating on the set of choices 90% I would not be certain of and whether of to be ascertain. And then a big folk with fur all over would get in and out of the store. You'd get in to wash your clothes and you'd end up wondering whether you should tip here too. And after you do, you'd still contemplate, whether giving a dollar to the spanish speaking folk was the right idea. Perhaps they don't tip on Staten? Perhaps it doesn't make sense if you're doing all the washing yourself? And then you'd end up in the chinese place next door and a couple of kids would get in ordering food. And you'd be eating yours and then a kid next would ask if you're gonna eat your meal. They'd be courteous and you'd be courteous and then you'd be eating your meal. And the other kids next would say he's a crackhead and doesn't have a buck. You'd steer away and keep eating your meal, not caring much and thinking, they're just joking around, fooling around kids. And the kids would be like this too. But perhaps this was true?
</p>

    <p>
I don't know, I didn't care. I did care, cause I was living just a block down, not even 3 minutes away. Just laying low, not knowing anyone, not knowing my neighbours and not even the people who lived in the same house. I just remember the set of houses at St Marks, how each was beautifully, amazingly distinct on their own. It was like a street where a set of history was laid out. Just houses, each distinct and truly unique, apparently each had its own architect and each felt as if this architect came from a different nation. Some were like castles. Some like skyrim. Some British and some Dutch. Some I could not tell. Some I could not begin to tell. What I could tell, though, was I preferred to keep laying low. And just being an individual but a loose cog, was something I was perfectly fine with. Nobody ever bugged me. And it was fine and quiet. Outside a mild mild hum. A police car waiting outside the store a block away, even if I passed walking by an entire station right next to a courthouse and a ferry, from which I'd venture down in and out of Manhattan. With the station having a bin with an emblem 'radioactive', oh no wait 'toxic', oh no wait, something else. Not volatile was it? The cops not giving a damn about where they parked their cars. Whether people were walking the streets on the red light. And whether they were waking people up deeper in Staten, with their dubstep WUB WUB lighting up and voicing up every now and then, deep into the night, the slumber. Away from a Montrealian party street filled with party folks, seeing a police car pulling up and receiving an applause in a form of "hey what is this dubstep" here for?
</p>

<p>
Man, I'd say I miss this. Although it felt like, you were just an individual. An individual parts of all the other individuals, broken and crazy hardboiled at whatever they would do. I felt weird though, wearing at times a vibrant baby blue coat, surrounded by all the grumpy clothed Staten individuals. And some tourists who didn't employ vibrance either. Just their cameras and smiles. And a thought coming through my head. Will I get on time. Will I not get run over this time? Or will I? And have to pay an equivalent of my entire stay in New York?

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>
