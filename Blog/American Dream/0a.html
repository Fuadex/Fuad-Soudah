    <p>I have a gift.</p>
    <p>I am able to create things that are imaginary. Primarily due to me not knowing things.</p>
    <p>But I also have a gift of destroying things. Also primarily due to me not knowing things.</p>
	<p>In the end, I don't know why either things happen. It's a conjuration form that I am not entirely able to control. The only thing is, to balance between imminent catastrophies.</p>
    <p>Usually I did it well. And even if I didn't, things turned out just better. But I think there's a limit to how many punches I can take. And I also wish to know why I'm taking them.</p>
    <p>My recent few weeks were hellish. And even when I thought I turned the tide, a sudden gauntlet met with my occiput. Then a second time... and I think, a third will show.</p>
    <p>I have known for quite some time my stay here in Sydney is decorated with a specific form of toxicity. But you don't know by how far it is affecting you, until you physically move your perspective and then, a good prognostic, you start realising things.</p>
    <p>Obvious. But as you're closed in four walls, you lose sight of them.</p>

  <center><h4>Framing</h4></center>

  <p>What I concluded after these few weeks, is something that I'd love to say startles me. But what it really does, it just makes me sad. When you're presented with a challenge, normally what happens you either take a fight or flight. There is a third option really, a synthesis of both - the creation of illusion. A world of your own. There is even an expression for it, of being delusional but if that's my case, I would have never gotten that far. And I always shared my love for the neutral, pragmatic and fair. But eventually, any values can become illegible.</p>

  <p>I went to Europe for a few reasons. First, I started hating being in Australia. I always wondered 'why do I keep coming back to Europe'. Once I showed up, from the many times I've done so, once again, I have answered my question: because I feel good and welcome here. To such a point, that even by my standards I became overwhelmed. I wanted to see my family. I wanted to rest from my studies. I wanted to see my friends... and a girl. That all sounds beautiful, now doesn't it? Now hold my beer.</p>

  <p>The balance sheet is as following: I came back sick, with a highly irritated finger, demolished feet, run-down shoulders. My powerbank from KAIST got damaged. My CIEM cable became unusable. The girl doesn't seem to like me anymore. The research report was not reviewed particularly favorably. I was coming back to Australia with a message in my head 'what the fuck just happened'. Because all of the sudden, the extremely warm welcome... I somehow managed to ruin everything. And I'm still not exactly sure how that happened.</p>

<!--   <p>To better portray what I have in mind, I will have to mix in times. And since I've been reluctant to write in the past few years, I don't believe I will be able to convey my thoughts anymore. But still, giving it a try.</p>

  <p>It all started waaay back. I don't even know how to position this. But maybe I'll just fastforward to the 2 days before my deadline for my Master's thesis. This was a very funny semester indeed. Really self-driven. And it came close to an ultimate catastrophy. Basically I couldn't do any work. I wouldn't wish it to my worst enemy. The disability to perform, conduct anything productive despite your very best efforts to do so and I mean it, it wasn't just pure procrastination, it was more of a mental paralysis, inertia to just do the thing.</p>

  <p>Now that I think about it, I'm thinking it all started waaay back. But it still shouldn't have affected me in my key semester and remain for around a month and a half. At some point I broke the square one circle. And I actually became exhilirated, because the work actually progressed marvelously. Yes, plenty of sleepless nights. That doesn't come without taking its toll. But it still went to such great extent that I truly believed I managed to achieve the impossible. I've designed a presentation, entirely animated, timed for under 20 minutes during which I talked and showcased and I truly believe I conveyed 95% of what I originally wanted. This was a presentation you could either love or hate. Many loved it. My research coordinator was much less impressed. Too fast-paced and overwhelming. I knew that well and frankly, I didn't think I could pull this off. But my ambition and will to excel, cost me points.</p>

  <p>Now that wasn't exactly a hit, 7/10 is not a bad mark. And I could have explained much more in my report. The report in which I concentrated on concentrating my research. Of which there was so much content that squeezing it all to 5000 words became a task that just became... doable. So I induced a wide span of references, theories and managed to cluster them accordingly. I threw in all I had and then... 2 days before my submission, I fell sick. With symptoms of particular extreme, severe migraines, bone pain, backbone aching on movement, fever. I've never ever had anything remotely like this. Frustrated, I tried to finish the thesis on time but when I realised my efforts were futile as what I was spitting out made no sense, I took this to the doctor, who diagnosed me with a viral infection and provided me with a medical statement. In addition, I had a flight scheduled on the 12th for Europe... This one I was not willing to pass on. And how surprised I was when the symptoms greatly dissipated right on the 12th.</p>

  <p>At this point I had no other choice but to finish this thesis on my way to Europe. Which I did in the plane en route to Singapore and Athens. And then, in Athens I finished writing it and submitted the appendix. It was a semi-rushed job. I frankly needed more time. But I was happy with how it read. And I felt everything was there and it fit most of the guidelines. I was exhausted at this point. I visited Singapore which did some good to me, as I was marvelled by what I saw. Athens was quite radically different, a bit of everything but distinct on its own. I'll get to this shortly but in the end, the research report did not see eye to eye with my coordinator. And I received the news on my way back to Australia, right in Singapore. That obviously was the second punch that took away any hope I had left. Sick, not severely but to some good degree still sick. Already demolished by the first punch, which I will explain further on. And from what I read, I wasn't marked on the 150+ objectively recorded work with much more unrecorded by rescuetime. It was more about the presentation of the work. And maybe she was right. But considering the effort put into making the components of this research, an emphasis spearheaded on and towards the quality of it and profound backing of what I'm saying. Finishing this semester with a mere 68/100 and getting merely a high pass on the report, if there's no other way to put it, just simply... demoralising.</p>

  <p>Especially once I consider what I've seen so far at this faculty. This is could have not been a disaster and may still not be as such but I think this closes my door for a potential PhD. One of my reasons for why I was doing this unit. Just seeing it all desolated. I'm not quite sure what to make of this.</p> -->
