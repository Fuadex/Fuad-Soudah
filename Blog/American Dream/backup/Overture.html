One of the things that I learned in past years, especially throughout my education journey is that, whatever you start, you need to finish. In a way, partially, it doesn't even matter if it's complete shit, all it matters is you deliver. Sure, you may get rebuked for a sloppy job but in the end, by doing, you learn and potentially do a better job in the future.
</p>

<p>
	I had the tendency to start doing something, get really passionate about it and eventually stop pursuing whatever I was doing, for a number of reasons. All the bad reasons, 'oh I don't have the skills to finish', 'Oh I can't do this', 'Oh I don't have the time', 'oh the sky is blue and chocolate potentially makes you fat', 'oh I'm dieting, I don't have the strength'. Well friend, the only good excuse is you may not have the time but then perhaps you can do it some other, smart way?
</p>

  </div><br>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Longstanding</h4></center>
    
<p>It's been a short while since my American Dream and I had all the means to really complete my journey in a scribed way. It's not like I don't have stuff to write about, there is tons! I tried to keep track of everything but as it was New York, you ain't got the time to even scribe stuff eventually, anymore. You sort of have to become a magician, who creates amazing stuff out of nothing but then once it all ends, you kind of shift in a different direction. It's nice to be unrealistic for a moment of a couple of months and try to live a dream, especially if it's somewhat framed and planned but not to one iota but eventually it's good to become realistic about what comes next. That, is even harder to do, when you dissolve the entire pressure stemming from a semester's work, I don't know, something pops up and collides the shit out of the speeding train, that then again, you gotta put on tracks but between the train being off those and starting to gain momentum, there's a lot of steps that kind of need to be taken and it's more chill to just leave it there for rust to take over.</p>

<p>
	You know, I don't blame myself as much, I know the amount of work that I have done and much of it is up there on the internet anyway. But maxed out 2 TB on my laptop in combination with my SDXC card and external SSD start becoming a bit of a petrifying power, that makes me feel powerless - oh, I need space but I want to do this but I can't leave all this shit off because it's all part of an important... ah, fuck. You need to negotiate between what you have, what you need to do and figure out a way out of this. So one way of me figuring it out is, well, finishing these damn blogs. Not many will eventually end up reading it. But I may have a nice throwback and you know, one of the important things about Design, is the reflective part.
</p>

<p>
	What worked well? What didn't? What could've been improved? If you had a chance how you would have made it better? It doesn't help that I didn't really see much beyond to do, I mean, perhaps but, I mean, fuck, I did so much in my time over there, so much that it even outshined much of the cohort that attends lectures over there. And I was doing shit that they even can't do in a semester. And I still had some other goals in mind but eventually, I don't know, it was a journey that concluded in colours, strongly bright, dissolved with time. Life moves a little too fast, you know? And then it slows down and you wish it kept on going just as fast.
</p>

<p>
	Still, looking back I think having this experience was crucial. Perhaps not from the perspective of having an oversees exchange as I've done that already but having the name and the experience and all the acquaintences that I've made during this time and more, there is a lot of added value to life from all this as a package. On second thought, that sounds strange to treat it all as a package, as not treated as such throughout the ongoing journey. But I guess you gotta stack it up all and against other stacks that pilled up throughout life. And if I think about how that all accumulated, I mean, I don't know, it seems like all added value in the end, the Master's program I am currently completing. I feel there is nothing else and nobody else that has done anything like this really and then again I see the weakspots on my end and somehow vaguely fail at addressing them. Bit tied hands on one end, bit reluctancy on my end to do anything with this.
</p>

<p>
	So it all goes on, I see progress and I wonder where it will all eventually lead up to. The last 5 years were a run of no other.

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>
