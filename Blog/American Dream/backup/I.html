  Lazily roaring engine in the background. A car door opening. A brief dialogue I overhear, as of light, as of rain, as of pure ignorance. I know there is a storm coming. It was coming for a while, while I was scorching in my bed, sneezing for days on a pair of pillows, which I assumed were triggering me sneezing but then there's the dust, and the sheet which is made exactly of a material that I sneeze.
</p>

<p>
  The storm did not come yet. But the cloudless sky eventually turned grey. The windless days turned up with a hint of a breeze. And there's me, laying in bed and writing these words. As if of any relevance to what the title suggests, or the series I am about to conceive. A Half-Life? An American Dream?
</p>

<p>
  Am I sane? Is this real?

    <br>

    <p>
      To start this story, I need to provide some form of an overview. A frame, scaffolding, anything. Naturally, I could just throw you straight into my last few months but that would lack a backbone, something for the story to stand on its own. A guy who got to study in New York? At no joke best art & design school in the states? Top 3 in the world? That nobody knows of? That nobody cares?
    </p>

    <p>
      See, now in the comfort of not having the need to deal with anything, I can really write anything, at anytime, as long as I feel like it, as long as my head does not explode from the heat, one that I never associated with this country and I certainly did associate with, well, Italy or Spain. Imagine riding a train with no AC and 35 degrees that you actually do truly and really feel. I know I compared with two countries that actually do seem particularly, culturally rich, as if I was to say Poland isn't. But somehow laying here, sneezing, on a partial caffeine-detox, although intoxicating nearly daily with friends who seem to have better things to do, like learn for their finals tests and exams, instead spending time with me and me forgetting, that they are in fact learning heaps to get through through to a better future. a future, that I'm seeing right here and now, a foreshadow that I am not necessarily happy of seeing, because it's almost like a good black mirror episode, feels so real. And while being happy about the quality of what I've seen, I can't be necessarily happy about what the contents do in fact depict, as in what it truly is.
    </p>

    <p>
      All this time, being in New York I was thinking, how will I react to what I will see outside of New York. A city that ultimately became the most crazy experience I've ever packed myself into. One, during which I had one major meltdown, from all the everything that was killing me, being in fact, everything. Now, while details will come, I really thought that moving back to Europe would provide a sense of settling, chill, winding down and being just, well, now cool in a state where it's just simply okay to be, relax, kick-back, don't worry about life. Which it in fact is (to some extent). But the problem is, that all this craziness got left in me. Although funnily enough, after seeing a few other cities in the process of coming here, Poland feels just as loony in a sense as did New York. It might however be just, that after New York, a person kind of sees more, which can't be the case but just might be.
    </p>

    <p>
      And it is killing me again, and it is scary. Because all of this feels like a cocktail, that ultimately has all the elements to make it work in being delicious but the bartender is fucked and twisted, instead messes up the portions and adds a few that ultimately make it a cyanide pill. One that you take, and for some reason you survive without any clear damage. Which should be carnage. But my life somehow is just one pile of antithetical. And despite being torn all the time, I somehow dip into some of the most imaginary opportunities that outshine many whom I've envied. Although after all this, the shoeshine pales and somewhat wears off and down with me wondering, as to what was the actual point of me journeying all the way. Not questioning its uniqueness but the idiosyncraticity kind of keeps pushing me into a high corner from which there is not that much that I can actually do. Or I just don't see what I could really potentially do with all that I've achieved, which makes matters worse.

    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>
