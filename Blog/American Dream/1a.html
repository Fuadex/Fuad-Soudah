    <p>It's kind of funny as just a few days ago I wanted to kill myself. Just as I'm sipping on a cup of mate, a kilo I've bought inspired by a friend of mine who I believe I have inspired way back to get into mate, as I definitely have loved club mate later in High School but the classic one was something I had discovered, I don't know even exactly how or why but I'm particularly sure I did not know at the time how a traditional, good cup of coffee tastes like. With years my taste buds got to taste something better, more pure and ground-up. But I frankly feel the same as if it was yesterday. On one hand that's good, my achievements have not quite spoiled me in the end and I prevailed as the very same Fuad. But hey, that's also a problem since I don't really see the changes that have appeared. I do in others but find it particularly difficult to identify those in myself. Hence I really value criticism elicited by others, I actually envy it. Once I see it justified, it even inspires me and I seek more information on how I can actually improve. This is all sort of the same level of funny but frankly, last weeks and years were heavy in its lightness.</p>

  <center><h4>Sink</h4></center>

  <p>It's all unbelieveable and I sort of like this.</p>

  <p>Except, I can't really say the same for when unexpected stuff happens with purely negative outlook, dissolving all my previous achievements, putting into question my own existence. To put it mildly, I didn't feel quite happy in a long time. Sure, bursts of more lightheaded bliss came and went, thereof can't really say it'd have been that bad but... despite it all, somehow did not translate into something of true meaningful nature. Then again, it is said that happiness is for stupid people. I don't know about that. But I know when I was happy, I definitely looked stupid then. Another example was when I fell in love. I tend to change my behavior, something that I don't really see straightaway but somehow nothing that I do at such time, seems to work and I forget literally even how to eat like a decent human being. Well now, that's stupid.</p>

  <p>I've went to Europe recently to take a break. I found tickets at ridiculously cheap level, at such extent that I was like, hell if I'm passing on the chance to see my family... and someone else and my beloved continent. And hey, everything would have went just fine, except: I got sick 2 days before departure and my Master's thesis deadline. At this point I was like, fuck... this is just the beginning. And hell it was. I was finishing the damn thing en route and ultimately in Athens. Not cool. My mindset was still occupied with this Master's thing. Sleeping? Fuck, that was reglemented as alcohol during times of hyperinflation. You don't see what it does to you at first but analysis hundreds if not thousands of pages and writing a 5500 word long paper based on an entire semester of over 150 hours (way more) put into... yeah, your mind melts. And everyone I've visited on my way in Europe, did see that with varying degrees of patience.</p>

  <p>On top of which I became sick. Had to finish another thing on deadline 2 days after submitting the Master's thesis. And despite all of that, I've been really actively sightseeing and visting friends in Germany, Athens, Singapore and Poland. Not in that particular order but with a jetlag in my head, you can imagine that I literally became contactive, well, what, a few days before I had my flights back? My special considerations were rejected because my doctor didn't fill them out right. I had plenty of shit being told by my family here in Sydney, there in Poland which made me realise, why I actually left one place and want to leave the other. I also desolated one friendship on my own selfish accord.</p>

  <p>It's funny, cause I don't consider myself a selfish person. But I definitely was out there, chaotic, erratic, not able to formulate sentences. I was definitely worn out, usually physically it has a moderate affect on me but mentally it's a complete different world. It's very sad cause it made me realise, this trip should have probably not happened. I couldn't have foreseen any of it. Especially my Master thesis being evaluated at such low grade, despite the hundreds of hours poured into it. The news that struck me on my way back, in Singapore. I couldn't have predicted I'd mess up friendships. Perhaps it's for the best? If friends who still enjoy hanging out with me despite me being mentally obliterated continue to do so, perhaps I should remain and value them more instead of people who'd easily reject me? Either way, I didn't feel good after all this. In fact, the misery was right in front of my eyes. So real, tangible... As if my future just went *PUFF*. At the windows and doors I preferred to keep open, just suddenly had tons of cement poured all over.</p>

  <p>That all changed with one simple email.</p>

    <p>I have been waiting for this for a long time. Actually, I didn't. I never saw that coming to be absolutely frank. My experience with this university and exchanges was that once you're nominated, and that's what they would usually tell you, it's pretty much granted you got in eventually. Because they would not nominate you somewhere that they thought you would not be able to get in. Makes sense right? But then they also told me that I wouldn't get into places that are restricted by faculty-bound agreements. Except, I inquired beforehand. And nobody told me 'don't apply'. Pulling on straws. I know the idiom goes differently. Then I got the news before I even got nominated, cause I just took a peek-a-boo. And I was like 'Fuck me!'. Actually I wasn't. I just became like I was on my long in years, first flight to Australia. I didn't feel a thing. I was just, 'what. how. is it real. how can that be that it is me. what does it mean?'. And the last question of 'what does it mean' remained for longer to the point I asked a few people, what does it mean to study there? Well, I'll discover it by myself soon enough. But as I as I thought it was granted, it was certainly not.</p>

    <p>I mean what does it mean to study at the best art & design school in America? Second in the world, right after the Royal College of Art. Are you getting mindboggled? At this stage, I preferred to get in where I got nominated, than as if I was to get admitted to Harvard or Oxford, Cambridge, MIT, Caltech or Berkeley. Do you see the scale here? If you do, that's cool. Let me know how it looks like, cause I absolutely didn't see one. It just broke through the roof and kept on speeding with me not even knowing what's the trajectory and its end. At this point, for me it could've been a neutrino. There were many things that managed to turn out for me at an unspeakable rate. But I have never heard of where I applied for, just once in fact. And nobody would have given me any chance to get to where I applied for. Not even myself. But as I find my life funny, I'd figure if I can't get in, at least I could is for others to consider me getting in. A perspective that was derived from... well.</p>

    <p>I don't know what it means to study at Parson's. But I know that I've been given a chance to live and study in one of the best places I could have ever imagined. This university has given me these chances and I will never forget it, despite all the shit I could put on it, same went for my faculty and the courses I was taking. I could probably settle where I am. The trip to Europe once again made my realise a lot of things that a person just forgets, once occupied with other things. Once living in a completely different environment. And I am still wondering 'what does it mean to study at Parson's'. Well tell you what. If it does something like, that a person who's just wanted to kill himself. Barred multiple pathways to the future, got massive mood swings and faced the reality of living a life in misery.</p>

    <p>All that, but primarily that wanted to kill himself or eventually just stagnate, which is not that different really. Suddenly turned ecstatic and willing to pursue life further, explore what it... look, if a simple letter of acceptance, which at this stage I know for sure was not just granted by a pure nomination at all. If Parson's can change that... at this stage, I'm sure I'll fit in. At this stage, I want to get in. At this stage, I'm willing to do all in my power to make this happen. It's a dream I've never known I've wanted. But since they've accepted me. Accepted me based on my cv, portfolio and the courses with all my grades that I've taken and achieved. I know I want this superunknown to become reality.</p>

    <p>Because it changed me. And put me closer towards a person I wanna be.</p>
