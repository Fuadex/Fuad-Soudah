    <center><h4>Restructuring the Research</h4></center>

    I have been fairly sure that my Research plan was conceiveable. Sure, I usually take upon myself to execute quite enormous chunks of work for a variety of reasons and I do get sometimes a bit carried away by what I think is most defintiely possible to be executed. I also usually like to do my best with each project I take upon, making sure that this very next one will be the absolute best I had in store and when I look back on the projects I have been committed to, I guess the quality can be seen, with some shortcomings here and there. It is a form of self-tracking, just as my website here itself. And once upon reflecting on my progress, I decided to undertake some changes with how my research will be carried out. Well, all this due to a short consultation that took place today.<br><br>

  </div><br>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Constrains man.</h4></center>
    So, what's the issue? Well, at first, that I already assumed that part of the research shouldn't be a problem whatsoever. I've been through this process recurrently, over and over again and to be honest, I believed I could execute all this with my eyes closed. What I also knew was, that all this does require time. At first, it doesn't seem like it but once you start actually doing the work, it turns out that all sorts of barrels start rolling down from the research/project hill. Some, did not seem to should have existed in the first place. Some I would foresee but handle badly. As I originally pointed out, time is the largest risk. And me not executing my plan efficiently over the course of past week is exactly what I was most worried about. It's week 7 and plan was still in shambles. I kind of know why and in theory I know how I could overcome this but all this takes time and it is of the essence.<br><br>

    So, what can I do instead? Well, instead of doing it the hard way, I could do it the efficient and smart way. By introducing a co-design workshop and generating together with other participants a coherent design for an application that would conceptually meet their needs. I think one of the issues still at hand is the poor communication generated on my side and incoherence in what my objectives are. In my head it is quite reasonable and straightforward but translating that properly is.. tricky. I'm still doing a capstone research project not a dissertation so putting a bit more quality into specific steps should radically enhance what I will eventually come up with. Instead of going through the entire UCD Process from Background research to wireframing, mockups and the application itself, I will blaze through each step together with other participants in a form of a focus group, of which aim will be the creation of a dashboard. What do people want to see there? What would make them want to look into the information? Keeping in constant touch can turn out tricky but that direct experience is something that seems a bit new. And I do like learning new approaches.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Planning onwards</h4></center>
    To make it more clear for myself, I will start collating what I know about the project right now and recruit participants for a co-design session held next week. I will come up with a questionnaire set to be held before the session begins and book a room to host the session. A set of post-it notes, A3 paper and a basic set of tools like pens, markers etc. will be provided. A short discussion on what the participants use to track themselves will be undertaken to see what tools, devices, applications people use and for which purpose and goals. The participants will be asked to create a 'mindmap' of what's important to them and what would they want to track. After 20 minutes we will see the results and discuss what we came up with for around 10 minutes. Afterwards the participants will be asked to draw what would they imagine their perfect dashboard would look like for around 15-30 minutes, depending on how much time they will need. The results will be put on the wall for us to comment on and reflect, whether such tools already exist and what would they think is the most needed.<br><br>

    ..<br><br>

    Afterwards I will analyse the same week the results and designs generated, come up with 2-3 coherent design variations and ask personally each participant for a structured feedback on what would be best for them. Once I gather the results by the end of the week I will execute an according PC/Android application, hopefully finished in a week or two. Deliver the device to each participant and ask them to do a digital sensitising booklet the results of which I will be able to see online throughout a week. During the course and upon its completion I will be able to introduce final tweaks to the application, provide the final version to the participants and seek their final comments and thoughts on it.<br><br>

Based on the plan, I believe a few outcomes could be arise. Could be a framework as you suggested. Could be also more theoretical, basically what do the students want to have tracked and what did they take out from the session. So quite qualitative.<br><br>

I derived the focus group technique from UX Design course I did 2 years ago. I did change it a bit, as originally it featured the sensitising activities done before the focus group took place. But I guess it is a research project so also researching a method of designing an application of reflection and self-tracking is a viable approach after all? Also the approach will probably seem much more clear and properly constrained :)<br><br>
