    <center><h4>Here's some new stuff</h4></center>
    Research Questions:<br><br>

- How open are digital companies in terms of sharing information on their users via API (application programming interface)?<br>

-- (Spin-off question) How much data and of what kind may be collated from which digital services and in what forms is it being shared?<br><br>

- How does a collated historical summary of information about a person affect that person and how can the person practically benefit from it?<br>

-- (Spin-off questions) What kind of information do we want to learn about ourselves? Is there any information that we would prefer not to know about ourselves? How do we feel about having all sorts of data about us being collected and how would we feel about it being collected in which instances?<br><br>

- What are the existing hardware-based solutions in terms of collecting user-data, how is it being currently utilised and how does the user benefit from it?<br>

- (Spin-off questions) How do the companies benefit from the user-data? Are there any restrictions established by the companies or governments in terms of collecting user-data? What array of software is being used in which geographical areas and how does that affect the openness of data shared by its users?<br><br>

  <center><h4><b>Keywords:</b> wearables, api, self-tracking</h4></center>
    <b>Significance:</b> An array of data is being collected on us by a range of companies, all supposedly for the benefit of us. However, there is no tool that I know of which would collate all this data and present how we evolved as a person, so that we can see changes that have happened and the direction taken. Despite that we share data all the time, we might not be getting the full potential/benefit from it. I'm curious to see, how far can this be stretched out and how may this affect the users themselves, along with potential outcomes for a variety of other stakeholders...<br><br>

..For instance private or government-owned companies, which may decide to increase the openness of their platforms for users to be more willing to share their data, hence increasing the transparency of those companies (one scenario, I guess it's a good idea to come up with those?)<br><br>

<b>Expected Outcomes:</b> A fully working cross-platform application making use of a range of modular APIs that can work in convergence and synergetically towards providing information potentially surprising, benefiting and unknown originally to its users. The users' approach towards the idea of tracking self will be researched beforehand as well as how the application impacts themselves and the transformation of how they thought and felt before they had access to the application and after they had used it.<br><br>

    <center><h4><b>Methodology:</b></h4></center>
The general approach would be to establish good guy Donald Norman's Double Diamond, a frameset to take upon any challenge in the design world but considering it is research and the design-world is ever-changing, I expect as much to shift (iteratively) in these regards.<br><br>

Background research covering: research papers, publications, journals, magazines, surveys conducted, existing hardware (devices and modules) and how it changed throughout the years (therefore, including trends), existing digital platforms in Australia and abroad, and the openness of their API (and how it works). Considering the topic of tracking may be also controversial, it might be a good idea to feature potential misuses and worries backed by influential literature and other media and how it was envisioned, from Orwell to Cyberpunk, Minority Report etc.<br><br>

<b>Ideation:</b> Tricky.<br><br>

User-Research: a mix of questionnaires and qualitative interview questions, I'm wondering in terms of whether I should do a T-Test or try surveying a few control groups, ex. internet sub-community on reddit (the turnout can be quite substantial!), students within the faculty, students from an overseas university etc. via ANOVA method; a focus group of 8 people could be an idea after letting the participants use the application for a ~week, User Scenarios, Personas, Persona-Based Scenarios<br><br>

Low-fi Prototyping: Sketches, Wireframes, Storyboards<br><br>

Mid-fi Prototyping: Mockups, Experience Prototype (rather Horizontal, probably working on Adobe XD)<br><br>

Hi-fi Prototyping (Artefact Development): At this time I'm aiming for developing a mobile application based on Processing via User-Centered Design with a high emphasis on testing its usability via HCI Techniques (NASA TLX or SUS), Fitts' and/or Hicks Law, GOMS and KLM (could be potentially not applicable to mobile devices, though) etc.<br><br>

-- Ad hoc, I feel like with this I might be skipping a bit ahead. I guess I ought to see what findings come out of the background research first and what needs can be derived from what users have to say. But all in all, especially considering this is research about tracking self, I'd rather stick to the general idea of APIs and, I guess in a way, mining those for the primary benefit of the users themselves. Also, this ^^above is a preliminary frame.<br><br>

 

Golden source? <u>Design. Think. Make. Break. Repeat.</u><br><br>

So far I just listed what came to my mind, next step is taking another run at this book.<br><br>

    <center><h4>aaand a few words to conclude:</h4></center>
    <b>Previous (Related) Works:</b> I have worked on a few occasions with API and wearables on both: theoretical and practical grounds:<br><br>

- Event Locator: Based on Processing, an application matching last.fm and songkick (?) data to visualise upcoming concerts of users' favourite artists in the USA. <a href="http://fuad.design/EventLocator">More about this at this link.</a><br><br>

- Unnamed: a research project utilising Machine Learning (with Python and SpaCy library), Virtual Reality environment built in Unity3D and Processing application made for extracting images with FlickrAPI to project nuanced environments in conjunction with featured songs and its lyrics. I didn't upload the .apk or other packages yet but the <a href="http://fuad.design/Lone%20Island">final (semi-finished) paper-format deliverable can be found here</a><br><br>

- HCI and smartwatches: I did a mini-(hci)-analysis around this topic and came up with a solution, that users might want to pay with their watches. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwstLuDQeW4">My participant liked the idea</a> More info can be found <a href="http://fuad.design/HCI2%20Mob">at this link</a><br><br>

<b>Current Issues:</b> I'm still struggling with myself in relation to making myself just do the work as I should be doing, considering I am actually very interested in doing it also in terms of my own spectrum and how much I could potentially learn through this work about myself and the differences between me and how others look at this but the procrastination is still winning this one, hopefully not for long!<br><br>

<b>Progress?</b> I'm still in the process of getting a grip on the topic, I have a few papers on my mind to go through and I'm also sorting the subpage on my website, where I'll be throwing in what I'm doing. So far, I made a retrospection to when I used Gear S3 for ~3 weeks while I was on exchange in Munich. It seems, that with just a few sensors, a smartwatch can actually gather a quite impressively comprehensive dataset and visualise it in a very informative manner. <a href="http://fuad.design/Blog/Tracking/3">I attached some lengthy screenshots with descriptions and translations (as I could not trigger an English version for some reason)</a> it's somewhat a take on a case study but I plan on going more comprehensively very soon and potentially delving into a paper on smartwatches that was featured a while back on Naseem's seminar, which I believe could align with what I'll be researching.<br><br>

Long story short, I plan on going a bit more technically and thoroughly on the case studies as suggested and preparing a ground-up, in-detail research.<br><br>

PS: I know I should have limited the post just to research questions but considering the students have provided quite extensive descriptions last week, I felt inclined to catch up with everyone :)<br><br>
