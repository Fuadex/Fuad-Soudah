    <center><h4>Trip to Techlab</h4></center>
    This time, we were scheduled for a trip to USYD's TechLab. This marks my second time there, as I have visited the lab either during Product Design or Digital Media Production course. I liked my previous encounter as I was able to familiarise myself with a few new devices that I never came across. The building floors feel inviting and the lab feels, well, open as well. This time the focus was on VR devices and wearables and in fact, we did manage to experience a wide array of devices. HTC Vive I have already known but unintuitive Hololens and surprisingly precise Oculus Go were interesting highlights.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Rollback</h4></center>
    In the end, we were introduced to a range of technologies I have already somehow known. However, the description and overview given by Jim were very insightful and featured a hands-on. We were invited to try a range of solutions there by ourselves, in some cases we came across inspirational solutions, such as 3D printed Oculus Go holders for the microcontroller. Ad hoc, this was the first VR experience I genuinely liked. The resolution seemed surprisingly very high and yet the experience incredibly fluent. It somehow aligned with what I thought VR would become under facebook's ownership, a complete private environment that can be established anywhere - as the solution was wireless.<br><br>

    I shouldn't be writing too much on VR as this won't be my focus of research, however, it prompted me to look up my own 360 videos. I have done quite a few so far in the span of recent 2 years, however they are so huge and require such an amount of post-processing and time for me to spend on, that I just diverted my attention to current work and other stuff. One video turned out to be of surprisingly bad quality due to bitrate. But the other that I captured in Munich was actually very decent... This opens up a few doors for me personally.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Data</h4></center>
    In terms of APIs I did not learn too much. In terms of wearables, a little bit. Augmented Reality is still not quite there. Smell and taste can be measured but only by industrial-grade hardware. Hearables are still restricted to rather few companies but there is some space around this area. And in terms of smartwatches bands? It is all the same. There are some companies that claim to have features such as measuring blood pressure but the claims are not verified academically.<br><br>

    In terms of data, though, there is one application that features in quite great length what I had on my mind. However, it requires a Chrome plugin and the insights it produced felt a bit generic. Still, I'll be looking into what is has to offer. I wonder whether such tools could function better in an open-source environment. After all, in theory, collating all the data should not require large resources, which remains to be seen.<br><br>

    I will be collating questions to ask experts and diving into potential solutions very soon, especially in relation to where do I extract the data from. There is a myriad of aspects to look into, therefore I ought to set up a questionnaire to send out to potential user-testing participants asap.<br><br>
