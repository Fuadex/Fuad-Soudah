    <center><h4>Research Proposal</h4></center>
    So, the presentation day. For this very day and the precedeing night I decided to not spend any time on sleeping and dedicate the entire time to making sure the proposal was kept to standards along with the presentation itself. I must have been out of my mind to start dieting just a week in advance and keep it up until the due date, as my productivity was severely capped. That having said, I believe I managed to drill through a number of papers and adapt relevant into the proposal.<br><br>

    In the end, a presentation was conceived in Powerpoint. I figured, after all these years, I guess managing it to be a bit more designerly and interactive, along with animations and narrative embedded could be a good idea, right?<br><br>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Presentation</h4></center>
    The number one issue in regards to creating the Proposal, was: what do I read?<br><br>

    It seems trivial but basically, whatever keyword I introduced, nothing really popped up and that put my research to a serious and a dangerous halt. During the meeting a week ago, I was told two names to look up. Eventually I did and it turned out that yes, research was done, pretty much within the field I'd be researching but not exactly what I was looking into. That should have sealed the deal, except, now was the part to read through all the relevant. Which went into countless pages...<br><br>

    Which is technically fine. Caffeine and some food, except for the comfort one, would keep me running, even if dried up. The beauty of a ketogenic diet is, that if you seriously keep to its frames, your head will seriously think clearly and consistently. No sugar crashes, no energy swings. Now, the bad part is, that if you don't keep to its frames, even step outside a notch, then you will feel this sugar craing really badly, once you get even a slightest taste of something sweet. And then there's obviously the first weeks energy cap.<br><br>

    Now, both did affect my work to a limited degree but I wouldn't say it necessarily would have made such a difference in the end. After all, I could have been not so productive without a diet enforced as well. I do like change, though, especially when it takes me towards, let's call it, the proper direction and once I see results, I get more diligent and consistent in my work. That somewhat did happen, along with a few kilo weightloss.<br><br>

    Eventually I had to filter through relevant readings of papers by <b>Judy Kay and/or Lie Ming Tang</b>. For this, I used <b>Google Scholar</b> which seemed to be ridiculously superior to the native usyd database. At least it pointed me, most of the time, to the right papers, all of which are natively available due to University of Sydney's network. Now that's a good design! I also decided to make use of Endnote, just to make sure I sorted the references properly. Which got messed up slightly in the process but I managed to fix many. Some were not done properly in terms of books for instance of the faculty's release. And this error actually comes from one of Usyd's database links.<br><br>

    Continuing. I decided to break down the idea into layers. First of all, the general idea of ubiquitous/pervasive computing, which I have learned already overseas but it shed some good light on what I'll be researching. Data is everywhere and is being collected by anything. Nowadays, our sofas may be even harvesting data and pushing it towards, well, somewhere. I noticed that some of my writings actually were very simialr to what I read in the papers. Which on one hand was nice, that meant my comprehension aligned with what the academia has to say. On the other, this is exactly why writing a paper should not start with what I know about the subject. But, oh well.<br><br>

    So, pervasive computing came first to give a layer of how data is everywhere and why is it everywhere? In theory, all for the benefit of the user, just so we can build an even more seamless world, hassle-free, good for everyone. Once I pictured this, I wanted to shift towards the microcosm of the macrocosm - Personal Informatics. It is important to know what it is, the context of it, what devices come into play and how it plays a role in our life, and by which means. But do they all mean anything without the human? What about the human? And so I narrowed down on Self-Determination Theory, which gave some very solid overview of what needs to be covered by humans for them to actually want to do something, by extrinsic or even intrisic motivation.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Long Story Short</h4></center>
    Still, the presentation was supposed to be just merely a presentation with all the requirements showcased on the assessment guideliens. Therefore, why this subject. What does it entail. What are the key readings and how am I going to do this. Research is quite distinctly different to a regular design project and this is something that is very good, finally research by semi-coursework and an opportunity to also learn further in a very interesting, rather self-driven stream. The entire thing was assembled in Powerpoint in a bit distinct way. <b>The idea was to facilitate my Surface pen as a tool to progress through the presentation.</b> That would have provided an interesting narrative. But unfortunately I was not able to connect my computer to the screen and I had to use a native mac solution, which jeopardised my fonts. Quite frustrating, which took a toll on my time available but, oh well. I continued, as I could do the same with a keyboard. Bit less impressive overall but my largest worry... hold on.<br><br>

    And so, reversing back I was a little bit worried about the presentation. First of all, the fact I did not sleep. Sure, at times, this is fine. But from my experience, I just know it does have an impact. You forget things, you don't think as clearly. Secondly, I was in the middle of my diet. Now, that has an even larger impact, as just my energy levels are capped and I had no idea how I would perform during the presentation in combation with this. I just knew, that I was severely tired. Then there's the enormous amounts of caffeine and electrolytes elements to keep me alive and calories consumed in previous hours. This sounds like an explosive combination but real-world work will probably impose some of this in even larger quantities in my future too. And I am somehow fine with it. And then obviously how my hardware would not connect and my presentation would look castrated. But most of the elements were in order and the animation-storytelling features felt essential.<br><br>

    It's very difficult to analyze how one performed. But I think after a few years of presenting your work, eventually you kind of get used to it. I think the trick in my case is to not treat it too seriously (so you don't freak out) but try to convince the audience of your points, that you know what you're talking about and needs to be done. The art of improvisation is a good one but I especially like to have this planned and executed smoothly, as if in between. It doesn't always happen this way and neither did really in this case absolutely. At some point I started running out of time as well and so I had to crank up the speed but I managed to touch upon a variety of points and all the rest? It was embedded in the presentation. And the explosive combination, turned out to be a rather soothing solution instead.<br><br>

    I believe the feedback was, that the presentation was good. But the general critical points were in relation to the scope of the project, which technically would entail a wide range of APIs. Also I was suggested to get in touch with people who have worked around the topic as well. In the end I have addressed some worries in relation to the project, after all some details are in the proposal and I could not include everything in the presentation. But it seems to have went well, which feels quite humbling.<br><br>

    So now, it's time for executing the plan.<br><br>
