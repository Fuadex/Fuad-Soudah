      <center><h4>Progress Report - 31/07/2018</h4></center>
      This week I had to concentrate on barrages of <b>Quizes, Homework and Exams</b><br>
      But that is quite fine, as I also worked on setting up a skeleton in my mind of how the research could be set up.<br><br>

      And so, the preliminary vision consists of a few elements:<br><br>

      - Researching <b>existing hardware, software and media</b> gathering various amounts of data and their impact on people's lives<br>
      - Researching <b>existing work focused around API</b>, predominantly precedent studies of works in Australia and hosted overseas<br>
      - Studying <b>people's behaviour and awareness</b> of what data they share and whether they use or are willing to use it in any form<br>
      - Finding out platforms that <b>offer API publicly</b> and finding ways of utilising the data it provides within foreset constrains<br>
      - Creating an application aggregating and <b>making use of publicly available APIs</b>, preferably based on social networks<br>
      - <b>Iterative User-Centered development</b> of the application and measuring changes occurring in users via iterative research<br><br>
