    <center><h4>Research</h4></center>
    Trying to research a relatively new topic can turn out quite tedious for anyone incredibly fast. Lets picture a frame, within which you have a clear idea of what you'd like to find. However, it turns out that the sources, that is the paint required to paint within the constrains imposed by the frame, are nowhere to be found! At this point, I'd tell any artist to go find a shop and get what they need but reserach doesn't tend to work like that, instead you need to spend hours looking for potential papers and figuring out whether they'd be of any use. Once you figure they might, you'll need to go through, reading them and then settling on whether you can actually use it as a building material, a foundation or details of what you'd like to be researching. At least, that's what my idea of research remains to stay within my head.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Keywords</h4></center>
    During our lecture two weeks back we were advised on how to perform our research and how settling on proper key words will speed up the research process. Of course, the person presenting was right. Despite I felt my keywords were highly relevant and should trigger appropriate responses from the databases I ventured into, I would get returned with nada. Well, some papers that were extremely technical in relation to programming languages but that was not what I was after. Well, partially at least.<br><br>

    So what was I after? Well, for starters, how about the definition of self tracking? Or Application Programming Interfaces? How about data as such, quantified self, personal informatics? Maybe wearables directly related to this? The fact that I was getting back with nothing, was quite excruciating and demotivating at best (worst?). I mean, how do I continue without having the foundation built. Task is quite hopeless, so instead I spent time on looking into wearables as such and analyzing this and that. Until I attended a meeting during which I was familiarised with two names from USyd, who were working with exactly the topics I was interested in looking into.<br><br>

  <center><h4>I can work like that.</h4></center>
    So at this point, my task was to chuck out the research conducted within and around the topic from Judy Kay and Lie Ming Tang. Perform and overview and then read through it once I figured it was relevant. That part, can get tedious fast too but there are a few angles to look at. What I got to read was relatively well presented but still the volume was huge. Whenever there was something particularly intriguing, I would look up the references. Which I did in terms of my unit coordinator's paper, leading me towards the psychological part, something I wish I could delve a little bit more into, as it could play a huge role in self tracking. It is also an integral part of design in one way or another.<br><br>

    So, my research continues, it doesn't look to hopeless all of a sudden. I sort of enjoy such productive twists in life, although I guess to prefer a more balanced workload could provide a nice stress relief, potentially boosting my overall productivity? I guess that's just the designer's regular workflow that needs to be sorted at some point in life.<br><br>
