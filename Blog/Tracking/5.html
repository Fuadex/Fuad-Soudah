    Every now and then we get hooked on trends.<br><br>
As much as I'm not keen on following any of them, I eventually like to develop some of my own. Even if they're already replications of others, such as my big t h i n k k emojis or calling everything interesting, which I genuinely do (maybe it's time for me to visit a psychiatrist?). That having said, at times I will point out to things that I especially have found unique.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Summary</h4></center>
    Despite the primary language used on exchange was English and all came from a variety of backgrounds.<br>
    <b>It was interesting to use, 4 different languages alternately.</b><br>
    As it turned out, there were people with ties to Poland, Germany and well I had to use basic Korean expressions daily.<br><br>

After having eaten the largest amount of meat ever in such a short time-span, treating myself to all you can eat arrangements and foods considered heavy.<br><b>It was interesting to see, that I lost weight in Korea.</b><br>..which is suspicious but I did break through the 75kg milestone after all.<br>Something very unlikely to happen but I guess the combination of studying, travelling and just doing stuff just burns calories.<br><br>

<b>It was interesting to experience, a process of 'growing on you'.</b><br>
It actually took an entire month but as time went by, this university and country combined transformed in my eyes radically.<br>
As I continuously discovered the more it offered to its students and as we were gradually treated by the program.<br><br>

<b>It was interesting to meet, so many great people from such a span of backgrounds.</b><br>
I just wish I was a little bit less crazy and a bit more social to get to know more but I guess I struck a fair balance eventually.<br>
There always remains the question of how much can you actually do in just nearly an already packed month? Which blazed through like a breeze?<br><br>

<b>It was interesting to learn, over half a book of Korean A1 in just merely a month.</b><br>
I have once done a feat of reaching half a B1 German certificate in just nearly 2 months. But with Korean, it was different.<br>I had no previous knowledge due to last semester's obligations. This alphabet requires getting accustomed to. And I really struggled. But survived.<br><br>

As always, I've gathered a laaarge amount of material.
And while I'm still feeling productive af, considering my upcoming obligations;<br> I might fail again to deliver a concise and quality retrospection of what I experienced.<br><br>

    <center><h4>vol. 2</h4></center>
    But let's continue.<br><br>

    <b>It was interesting to eat, a very healthy Korean cuisine.</b><br>
It's debatable but a combination of meats and pickled veggies is something that I'd call the ultimate cuisine. It was often spicy and provided in a variety of small amounts.<br>
What almost killed me, was the quite surprisingly frequent all-you-can-eat arrangements, that were relatively inexpensive. Espeially, the all you can eat BBQ was the bomb.<br><br>

    <b>It was interesting to drink... well, not just Soju.</b><br>
Obviously, Soju is the nr. 1, very inexpensive drink in Korea. And that is the drink that almost knocked me out on my last night out. So innocently looking, comes in flavours.<br>
But going out to bars was quite magical too. It often ended interestingly too. And many, many Koreans end up, primarily after Soju, interesingly too. It's the culture, yet familiar.<br><br>

    <b>It was interesting to find, the arguably best coffe place I have ever been to.</b><br>
What does such a place look like? Well it welcomes you with coffee roasting machinery to start with. But it's also the ever-smiling owner, greeting you. Offering frequently refills. Providing an option to choose from a variety of coffee beans roasted on the spot. Or getting a quality Americano for a ridiculously low equivalent of 2.5 AUD. Especially the first one I had, which didn't taste like much... and then subtle and more distinct notions of liquorice unraveled. Coming midway with citrus elements and finishing up with a bulge of mint. And it was not just coffee but tea was great too. And their wifi beat the speeds offered at KAIST too! It wasn't just one feature, it was the balance of everything that came into picture.<br><br>

    <b>It was interesting to find out, that students at KAIST have a life</b><br>
Now that might seem harsh but hell, there is so much offered on campus and outside that showcases the pattern study hard, party hard and... well, hobby hard?<br>
You don't see it too much from the outside but the devil's hidden in the details. An impressive variety of sports equipment to be borrowed and used at KAIST's facilities.<br>
Many, well equipped gyms. A swimming pool. Place to play pool. Do Karaoke. Buy a bicycle. Rehearsal rooms to play in bands. Most of it... free of charge or at a small price.<br><br>

    Ultimately, <b>It was interesting to study, at a top Technical University in Korea.</b><br>
I have learned in different systems but learning at KAIST was truly an experience. One for which I even reduced load but it still matched 6 CP I'd do in Sydney.<br>
The tempo imposed at this university, was crazy. And it's a miracle that we all managed to stuff at least some social stuff in such packed timeframe.<br>
 You don't see the quality at first but eventually it comes around in many different forms. I doubted my decision of coming here at times, unnecessarily.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Few more notions</h4></center>
    The journey doesn't end there.<br><br>

    <b>Have you ever been to a library that you'd wholeheartedly wish to live and study in?</b><br>
KAIST does have one. And it made me realise why Libraries are built often in such stunning variations all around the world. But while the architecture from outside might be stunning and awe-inspiring the interiors usually present with the very same, dull and mind deafening setting. KAIST's library is the exact opposite in both senses. This is actually the first library that actually made me want to study. It may feel a notch inhumane but it has all the facilities and settings a student might wish to immerse themselves in. I wish I knew of it first I came.<br><br>

    <b>Have you ever been to a country, which was gorgeous regardless of how you roamed it?</b><br>
You could pick a bicycle in Daejeon and you'd love exploring the riversides. You could take a train to literally anywhere and gaze at the wonderful mountain ranges blending into the picture, with a selection of valleys, rivers, lakes and the urban world popping out of nowhere. You could pick a Bus and see just as much. But if you took a plane, had a window and a cloudless sky on given day, you'd be suspect to a mind-boggling feast. The Korean peninsula is gorgeous, however you decide to explore it.<br><br>

    <b>Have you ever been to a country, that felt Déjà vu-like, although so distant and far away?</b><br>
Korea felt very much like Europe, actually. In terms of the flora, very alike. Tons of mosquitoes out there to hunt ya ass. The drinking culture partially stengthened. The cuisine in forms reminding of what I know. But still all so distinct in its own form that felt again like a crossover between a variety of cultures with known parts perfected to its core, like my favorite coffee place and forms that were rather local like Karaoke but stylized in such forms, that could be criticised as lacking taste but I have not seen anything alike. I mean - Korean Berlin??<br><br>

    and.. <b>Have you ever been to a country.. hm. Oh, see for yourself!</b><br>
I'd recommend visiting it yourself. There is a handful to be explored. Want a garganteous city with neverending places to venture through with blissful nightlife? Here's Seoul. Want marvelous beaches, distinct culture and just as flourishing nightlife? There's Busan. Want to do lots of hiking, chill at a beach or just chill wherever? Jeju is the destination. How about concentrating on nature and hiking? Can't go wrong with Seoraksan National Park. Studying, limitly exploring and enjoying a distinct night out? Oh well, Daejeon!<br><br>

There is certainly more to be explored, although I feel like I managed to stretch out my experience quite substantially already.<br>
I'd also pop a few critical lines here, something I was reminded a few times by my peers (did I become that much of a sour man??) but I'll leave it for other, more extensive blogs.<br>
They'll be up. Eventually.<br><br>
Korea was a great destination to visit and study. Culturally enriching and eye-opening.<br>
K, Back to a mix of mundane and continually crazy if I make it Sydneyside life.<br>Perhaps I'll be able to enhance my productivity and <b>continue the positive.</b><br><br>
