      What else have I learned in due process. Divising this into 4 last sections isn't easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I mean, think about it, how do you summarise your last 11 months that happened a few years back into just 4 very specific sections aka extensive blog posts aka whatever the hell all this is?
    </p>

    <p>
      Yeah, you got that right, this entire Sehnsucht section is much broader than these 4 entries. But I think it would be neat if I could close this series with a selection of what I think were the largest things that I have taken out from this experience collective.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started by talking about my finances. One of the things that I was kept bugged with essentially whomever I'd talk with about my experience overseas. Which is perfectly understandable considering the extent of what I've done but I seriously disliked this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, talking about finances. What would I prefer to talk about then?

  <center><h4>The World is Bigger</h4></center>


    <p>
      One big thing is the opportunity to travel while you're young. I think that's an easy one but I think shedding bits more light onto this could make things a bit clearer to the outer audience as to why I decided to do as I've done, which was a seriously extensive and straining combination of going out and about and all over, pretty much predominantly Western Europe or within the boundaries of the European Union.
    </p>

    <p>
      See, the thing is, that throughout my first pretty much first 18 years I haven't had really travelled much. Theoretically, I moved around while I was a really small kid. Even visited New York when I was an infant! Does that count? Heck no by any standards if I don't remember any of it, how could it? Fastforward today, I'm thinking, then if I don't remember my experience of being somewhere while being really little then how should I justify that anything else counts while I was, for instance, a teenager if I don't recount much? For instance of what I learned, what I ate, what I've done etc. That's not all true but food for thought, there are many things that I've long left gone in my head and clinging to all this isn't necessarily healthy but I think a bit of reflection does make way for something better coming afterwards and the future, for which it's probably a good idea to have a plan for. Even if it shifts and changes and comes to fruition or desolution, it's still good to have a sense of going somewhere, instead of sludging in the past or present without anywhere visible to go to.
    </p>

    <p>
      In any case, being in one place during my kid and teenager years wasn't necessarily very healthy for me either. There was a small selection of places I really got the opportunity to travel. Among them were pretty much (after having moved to Poland after the first 6 years spent in OZ): Germany, Bulgaria, Croatia, Turkey, Czechia, Austria, Lithuania and Spain. Not a bad selection but it turns really bland when you think about how much people get to see nowadays, as kids, as adults as everyone else in fact and I felt this all still was a bit diminished in my end, in the way that, I felt at times punished primarily for bad marks at school and as a result barred from having many options of going anywhere else outside of where I lived. And there was the case of my family being overly protective, which I feel quite angry about to this very day, as I felt this ended up with me being quite incapacitated in many ways to this very day. Some of the problems of which I was able to overcome over the course of years but it's hard to get anywhere near ahead, considering all the others were starting from a more robust standing point and were able to achieve much more than I, in many cases due to very trivial things that I could not get sorted, again, to this very day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then it started shifting a bit, of course first time that I moved to Australia, I moved through Dubai. Then it was a bit of a turmoil on my end back home and I had to move around in Sydney, which was a quite shitty time, as I look back from today, I seriously could have fixed it all in a better manner. But then I kind of got some things sorted, some I did not and made them even worse in ways, unnecessarily by the way. I got to visit, though, Thailand, Italy, Austria, Jordan, missed out on India for a stupid reason but oh well. And then there was a mix but before the exchange kicked off, I got to see Taipei and now quite in depth Netherlands, Belgium, not so in depth France and then it somehow started somehow by going to Europe through Qatar with the first two months really spent within the Germany, Poland duo to get things sorted.

    <center><h4>And then...</h4></center>

    <p>
      Once I realised certain things, which were just things that really came through my head but didn't necessarily reflect the reality, I began moving seriously about, sometime in November. First trips were a bit funny, though. Not that the following weren't any.
</p>

<p>
  At least reviewing how I've done them is becoming seriously blurry even when I look at my google timeline mapping, which seems suspiciously vague. For instance, how do I get to Poland from Munich? It tells me I somehow made my way to Dresden then Wrocław, Piotrków Trybunalski (?) and then Warsaw. Again, the details are very vague and this was probably due to my phone being quite seriously bad in terms of keeping its battery intact. Which meant that, well, I had to get it into energy efficient mode whenever possible and I didn't really know of such a beautiful invention which a powerbank is. For the entirety of my stay in Germany in fact. Whenever possible, I used my laptop as a powerbank. Yeah, seriously.
</p>

<p>
  That having said, there were the trips, finding a Deutsche Bahn to Dresden for max 25 Euros and then from Dresden taking a Bus to Wrocław, either a polskibus or flixbus, either way for probably an equivalent of up to 20 Euros, maximum, probably even half that, then taking a train from Wrocław to Warsaw on ISIC Card for probably about 40 PLN (8-9 Euros). It was a game of fitting into some more or less oblique holes, which weren't necessarily loopholes but sort of a hunting game, as some Deutsche Bahn tickets will elevate up to 100 Euros per ride, yet some will go for bit less than 20 Euros, if they're still on sale or just not that many people booked the tickets yet. Same going for bus routes, although here a set of 5 vouchers for 100 Euros on flixbus would save my ass every now and then, whenever a ride cost more than 20 Euros. At times, there were more decent alternatives. But the thing that for my took the cake was the national railway carrier in Poland, which has this thing of having discounted student tickets on the following conditions: you're under 26, you're studying outside of Poland and have in posesssion an ISIC Card and... that you're a Polish citizen. The rides are often fast, comfortable and I certainly had options once I got into the country that were just dirt cheap (up to 10 Euros a ride from pretty much anywhere in the country to anywhere else, excluding the most expensive Premium services, which had its drawbacks compared to other offered options).
</p>

<p>
  Now I don't remember how I got back. Sometimes I'd settle for a plane, even if pricey, I could get some decent luggage onboard of up to 23 kg at times and with such volume you could get lots of stuff between cities. Sometimes when family visited, they'd take the bus, which would be pricey (140-200 PLN/30-45 Eur) but at least provided a fairly straightforward connection. I usually looked for more economical solutions, though. Sometimes I had to go a bit more creative, like when I transported a bicycle to Munich. In such case I took a train from Warsaw to Prague and from there, had to find a flixbus that allowed to carry the bicycle at the back of the bus. Most of the rest, it was pretty much just flixbus all over Europe, since it's so cheap. Sometimes a train connection. Like in Switzerland, when it felt economical or Italy or Netherlands. Usually the limit I imposed was of up to 20 Euros and sometimes Deutsche Bahn had some pretty decent international deals for its IC Buses, which constantly changed and even trains. Sometimes funny things happened, like me getting to Budapest and realising my return ticket was cancelled, basically due to some payment error that I was discovered by flixbus. In the end I had a free one-way ride in such case and I think I even received a voucher for the error for some reason. Sometimes it was easier to get into a country rather than leave it, because I looked slightly suspicious but when I said I did basically a day trip, I was let through. Sometimes I'd find myself on a train full of ultras football fans and realising that maybe it's the end of me but instead was being treated to a couple of beers and interesting conversations.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes I could not move due to intensive coursework, sometimes I moved despite having exams right around the corner and eventually miraculously passing them despite travelling around Europe. Sometimes I had to do some weird flexes to get for instance to Netherlands to take a return ticket back to Warsaw which I booked more than half a year ago, figuring that maybe I'll take that ticket back. Sometimes I'd discover upon returning that there's a giant party happening outside my bungalow. Sometimes the train would arrive at destination and hour and a half faster than expected. You know, there was lots and lots of stuff happening that was just unique in its own way and obviously lots that I would manage to discover in this process. Basically, one of the things was just purely how inexpensive it fairly was to actually move around the continent and even just simply European Union as is. And there were some other options that I didn't make use of like hitchhiking or blablacar. But there were times for instance when I got into a car to Łódź. Or for instance other funny thing, when a student ISIC monthly ticket was cheaper in Budapest than a 3-day normal ticket. I heard of other interesting options like, Slovakia making their trains free for student from everywhere to move with. Or France having all of its museums open for free to people under the age of 26 for EU citizens.
</p>

<p>
  You know, all this requires research but once you complete all this and lots that you had scheduled, you're suddenly feeling quite content about what you were able to achieve, even if with time it all sort of loses its magic, once you've seen a serious plenty.

    <center><h4>But that having said</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      The couple of things that really came through all this, were the following.
    </p>

    <p>
      Travelling can be seriously cheap, even dirt cheap. And I haven't even mentioned ryanair or wizzair, cheap flight carriers that can move you around the continent for even as little as 5 Euros, although at times with strings attached (like getting back and forth from the airport). But some people can do it even cheaper. By hitchhiking. Not eating at establishments, which I'd be prone to do and which would create the largest dent in my finances. Not necessarily anything very fancy but like a place to eat something fairly authentic, could still ramp up to 20 Euros on its own. But having the opportunity to move between cities during the night as I would often try to create very specific connections between to rest between destinations, was the largest godsend. Obviously, maintaining proper hygiene becomes an issue at this stage. But if I was doing roundtrips taking for instance just for a weekend or up to 4 days, I was willing to bite the bullet and just do it to squeeze as much as possible in as little as possible, striking the optimal balance between what I could do and see, maintaining safety and still retaining some part of human decency and being. In the end, I felt like I could have done much more. But in barely 11 months with studies on my head, I was able to just make a killing and see more in my life than every before, even during my 12 years of my upbringing in Poland.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in case of studies. It turns out, that doing those trips as well during studies, is not necessarily such a bad thing. Despite being bombed with material that extended to over 1500 slides packed with content, you know, you really need a change of pace, scenery, something to just refresh yourself, restart, get ahold of your personal wellbeing and becoming something.. more sane, as these times can be really trying for one and anyone. Despite doing some trips at the most pressing times, I was still able to manage the material and nail some stuff in the process. And that didn't quite just contain itself to studies but just life on its own. I found travelling to be a great form of retreat and that's where it all really seriously started. Yearning for something else, detaching from the current, going somewhere else and not having to think about your current life and whatever you're suffering from and just go out, see something seriously else, keep yourself occupied by moving, seeing, moving, seeing, resting and repeating all this, tiring yourself out, filling your head with an entire plethora of sensual carpet bombardment that in the end just simply works and keeps you going.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then it's obviously the entire spectrum of just how diverse the world is. Getting to know how things work just even a few hours away, how people communicate, do, have built their places, what are their routines, what they like, dislike, cultural differences, cuisines, similarities, the hotpot of everything divised within the continent that you just get to see and be a witness to, that crushes a series of perceptions built from other sources and eventually confronting yourself with a set of reality that in the end isn't necessarily as bleak or perhaps is, depending on the season, weather conditions, many other things. But you still get to see a lot and remember a lot even after all these years, perhaps with many of the details thrown away to the abyss of life but as you live you will subconciously associate all this with previous experiences. It's just how it is and there is beauty in all this.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a beautiful world and you see this, whenever and however you decide to travel. But you have to move to see any of it, otherwise, your perception just is and will remain limited.
    </p>

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

    <center><h4>As well</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      A few words about sports. Upon entering Male I was actually quite amazed with how narrow streets there were. And how cheap it kinda was. And then I saw also some people playing some weird game I have not seen by flicking pieces on a board. Now I am at the airport. And they were some thing popping up. A rock concert running for quite a bit by an Asian rock band. Then some Criquette. And then, holy shit, Premiere League and whoever's left at the airport. Hindi, Mali, flight attendants, police officers, they're watching. To speak of an experience binding cultures and generations. Amazing.</p>

<p>I mean, Male is not a special place. In fact, this is a country that you'll go to, only and solely for the purpose of going for a holiday but only to a resort. A private resort. One you'll need a speedboat or a water plane to get to. The hotel I was in, which was an inn actually, wasn't that bad. I had some problems with finding a good place and eventually I booked this last-minute which was a good decision, although a bit stressful one. Basically I put forward a bit more money but I received the bang for the buck - taxi all the way to the place and from the hotel to the airport at the place's cost. I got breakfast, which was a set of take what you need: fried eggs, sausages, broccoli, some pastries, fruits etc. I got a refill and some coffee. Also you had a coffee machine in the place and tea and bottles of water, all complimentary. All this, for a bit like 70U$. I felt like it was a good decision in the end. Although I feel I should have booked something else, also had wifi and the luggage carried which was unexpected. Got wifi. And the other complimentary stuff, I mean it was literally a 4-star hotel. Perhaps 3 but on the verge of being a 4. And I got my sleep. 7.5 hours. That's a lifesaver, trust me folks on this one.</p>

<p>One of the last problems that I am standing in front of, is my condition. Usually when I assemble my travel puzzle pieces I don't really take under consideration the fact that me, as any other person, can fall ill. I mean, obviously there are the hazard of eating in Delhi or getting some forms of malaria etc. But what I usually don't really take seriously is my condition to just fall ill and it all starts from dust. I started feeling a bit off while in Poland and then for serious in Helsinki, although it got better. Eventually, perhaps the large rollercoaster of AC and humid heat decided to stir shit in my body and in the end, at the airport, I am basically inept a bit. As in, sneezing, yellow phlegm. Kinda standard and the funniest part - it always gets to me at least once or twice a year. It's great that I decided to cut short my trip, hehe, as shorter it gets I mean, by having a shorter transfer in Kuala Lumpur. This way I will be able to get home faster but at the same time, there are hazard associated - cold aircraft's AC, the need for food and water. Basically I won't end up seeing anything in KUL but perhaps I'll be able to go to sleep faster. That's what I'm counting on. It's good that they had showers at Male's airport, this way I was able to get off all this sweat that I've accumulated in hectolitres while stumbling through Male. That probably also contributed negatively. Oh well.</p>

<p>Being deprived of sleep creates very interesting cognitive patterns. At times you'd feel as if you've seen something, like a mild form of -nesia kicks in. Also, listening to music makes you realize, that it is kind of deprived a bit of bass. Tonal environment and reception is especially interesting.</p>
