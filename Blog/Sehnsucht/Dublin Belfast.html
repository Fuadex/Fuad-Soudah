      That might be one of my easiest blogs to write. Don't get me wrong, Ireland is actually a pretty great place to live (currently), placed on an Island, a destination towards which millions actually try immigrating to. Well, perhaps not as popular as it's big blocky United Kingdom/Great Britain, whatever it's called (still got some trouble), but then many politicians back in Poland referred to it as 'Green Island', whereas it wasn't only for Ireland being in a bloke's mind green, as green an Island can get, or this particular one being known for its four leaf clover greenish emblem, or actually the country itself referring to green in many more ways as I could imagine. Green, because of its economical success, the one many back in Poland yearned for years I guess starting from... forever?

      Well, look, the thing is, Ireland wasn't always a 'green island'. Or was it actually? In fact, the British raped the Irish in a number of ways, pushing it so far as to making it starve for quite a while, leaving the population quite doomed and many emigrating towards more prospective lands for their and families sake, most primarily United States as I recall. But it wasn't for Ireland being not fertile, but the British, actually taking the most of crops and profit for themselves. I'm sad to disclose this, but I'm not that familiar with the Irish history and I was really keen and looking forward to educating myself while actually being in Ireland. Guess what? I didn't really get a good shot at it. And I'm actually wondering whether it was for the best, but then, some symbols are still present. Such as the real masterpiece of work, the sculpture of the great famine, from what I learned, imported from Canada. As far as for sculptures goes, that could have been probably, if not one of the best, quite the best in terms of how touching, moving? Poignant. That might be the word I was looking for. Kind of reminds a person of horrors of war, but then, it didn't necessarily have to do much with it. Nor did the great famine in Ukraine for that matter. Nearly or just merely politics, classic imperialism at its worst, yet, about the famine in Ireland, even I was surprised to learn just about 2 years ago, by a flick of some sort of grotesque luck while going through with some of my, back then, mates. 'DEATH', 'DEATH' pointing at people of certain nationalities and clearing the slate of that many, Polish among.</p>

<p>There are some attractions that a person does not come across, thinking, it might be of great significance. Take churches for that matter. They are everywhere in Europe and of absolute honesty, why do I keep checking up on them? It seems as if I keep on hitting replay button, just in certain other destinations, a little warmer, a little less warm. A person hardly can learn of a nation while just bouncing back and off the great pedestals of fate, to which masses turned more or less blindly, yearning for something better to pop up in the future, or for other's sake future. Under this angle, there was not that much in Dublin or Belfast, although Dublin had a quite impressive St. Patrick's Cathedral (Church?), for which it could possibly be proud of. In fact, the city itself didn't leave that much of a mark. I continued to travel by bus from the airport, a really cheap ticket in fact, I believe it was, 3,30 Euros? Counted up to the last coin, no change, no whatsoever from the driver. A double decker riding through the entire city, even I at some point figured out, that this bus's destination is not the city center, once I rolled into the Dublin's, quite lovely suburbs. I hopped out, a little embarrassed, stirred up, afraid I'll have to pay a fine or something. But nothing really happened to be honest. Just started off my journey, a little bit far out, off my course.

     Although at first my impressions were distorted by the gruesome outlook of the train/bus station and afterwards the people of Ljubljana, who seemed egocentric, rushing one way or another, not giving a single, two fucks about the others, once I reached the actual center of the city, it seemed so peaceful. Especially around the castle area, but the beauty was easily intercepted. A handful of beautifully kept, well maintained bridges. Alike and in harmony with the area. Trimmed trees, symmetrically spaced along the river. Stylish, subtly colorful, rather minimal but old style, romanian (?) architecture. A mix of international brands' storefronts and single businesses', which blended together quite nicely, minimal and well designed brands.</p>

<p>I was incredibly rushing as I had merely just 3 hours to spend in the city. The compact nature of the city center helped notoriously, but as my roaming aldi prepaid failed and so did the power outlets in the bus I took, both, from Munich to Zagreb and from Zagreb to Ljubljana, I had to charge my phone (12%!) and buy a ticket back to Munich. How do I manage that in a city I don't know and even without a google maps outline of the city? I was entirely blind and had just one idea in my head: find a university. No power outlets at the train station either. Strange wifi and purchasing anything through it would be a death sentence, so bam I marched ahead, figuring that perhaps, well, 'that could be south', lol. I was right. I reached the university. Plugged myself in and used Eduroam. Finally I knew where I was and my orientation skills worked as a marvel this time alone. But I squandered around 20 minutes. Oh, did I say I squandered 20 minutes? Well, triple/quadruple that I spent in the castle area. That's right, the tranquility, the pleasure of experiencing the sunset and... peace and beauty.

First stop? Convenience store. I was really looking forward to having a bottle of water. Or was it coffee that I was after? Rolled into SPAR. Being kinda rude, countered abash 'hello' once I passed by the young saleswoman counter. Grabbed a cup of regular Americana, straight from the express for 2 Euros. Beforehand even a piece of cadburry vanilla ice cream stuffed with pieces of chocolate. Got the counter. 'Niiiceeee', a comment from the saleswoman. 'Is that a straight black?', 'Yep, regular Americana', 'Cool'. Requested to pay by card. 'Just from 5 Euros, soorrryyyy'. Looked around. Grabbed a tube of spearmints. 'Oh, niiiceeee', another comment. 'Can I tap it?', 'Sure.'. 'Cheers!'. Now, that attitude kind of got me thinking. The scene seems generic and it should, but there was this sincerity in what I experienced in just a regular chain world conglomerate, in which I failed to find anything edible-Irish. The lady was turbo nice and I continued to meet such people on my way a few times at least. Once, I tried getting a tram ticket, as my feet were almost dead after all my up to date trips. Instead, I heard an 'Excuse me? Would you like to use this ticket? It works in Central the other way, you can use it.' Again, abashed I replied 'Thanks', startledly gazing at the object given to me, as if someone was trying to ruse me, as I kinda did not know how the ticketing system works in Dublin. Unfortunately, not all the systems in all of my destinations were customer friendly. This time, I got a ticket for free, from a mere stranger. At a bar I decided to hit in the known touristfriendly area, recommended on wikitravel, in which I was driven by a classic Irish cuisine (element to be honest), I experienced once again, a surprising as if familiar, natural way of how dwellers get by. The distinct, rough accent of the mature males. Even if a bit drunk, still conversing with dignity rather than aggression. The jokes thrown around. Pleasant offers if I needed anything. They run out of a stout beer? I was offered regretfully an equivalent stout. People were lively. Relatively cheerful, how about just lively and pleasant? Which was quite surprising given the country's history.</p>

<p>The city itself does give a glimpse of its own history, though. In my personal opinion, it does have a far way to go, compared to many European cities in terms of what's actually within in, abstracting from the people themselves, who they are, how they get by and how pleasantly surprised I was by what I came across. The city itself doesn't have that much to offer culturally, though. I heard of Cork, being originally preserved. I wish I'd known that before I booked all the tickets, though. I hit the capital's national gallery. It was indeed a really small gallery, with a few works of some internationally recognized masters, in which I found a pearl. William John Leech, a postimpressionist of whom I've had the pleasure, joy of experiencing, a non-photographable (as most of the exhibition), swirl and unspoken, comprehensible festival of chaotic mishmash, put into a logical, as if a mirage, almost photograph-like portraits, close to real, although magical and as if surreal painting of his most likely of all, beloved wife. Put into a composition of subtle greens and whites, even more subtle touches of other velvety palette. I hope I described it correctly. Despite, it was still worth attending for even just 15 minutes to contemplate alone on just one painting displayed, but then, what was hosted, mere a far cry of what's available in other capitals and cities worldwide. Apparently they have an impressive collection of Celtic gold. But the museum closed the admission an hour before. It was uplifting to learn that the gallery was free of charge, though. After having spent 9,5 Euros (slightly discounted!) on seeing the Trinity's College Old Library. Which, in fact, was worth experiencing for 15 minutes alone alike, as such atmospheric places are really rare, worldwide alike. So much knowledge. Stuffed in one place. Being conserved and preserved for ages to come. Survived throughout ages and turmoil. With statues of great philosophers, scientists and more, overlooking in rows the entire structure, which in fact, is one of a kind. Trinity College itself? Beautiful as well. Such places made Dublin grow in my eyes at such rate, that it totally overshadowed how mediocre the general city was. As I mentioned beforehand, most likely a hit after a range of thinner years, as if postcolonial, but with a strong sense of dignity preserved and pearls stuffed here and there.</p>

<p>And of dignity speaking. Dublin left an impression of a highly nationalistic nation. It could have been just a mere impression, but then one can't overlook the signs of underlining how Irish Ireland is, starting off with landing in Ireland itself, with one of the probably best marketing campaigns rolled out in the welcoming halls leading towards the exit. Very high resolution pictures, showcasing the beauty of selected destinations. Some statistics and definitions put towards, giving a glimpse of what Ireland is built of, all in superlatives. Gaelic used as first, put forward. Advertising over and over showcasing products being Irish and how proud they are for being Irish. A great contrast, compared to what I've seen in Belfast.

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      Wycinek z mojego życia. Jakże piękny, co? Szczerze, myślałem, że w wieku 18 lat już stanę się dorosły. W zasadzie to nie ma tu nic przeciw, wszystko się zgadza, w wieku 18 lat wypierdoliłem na drugi skraj ziemi, usadowiłem się w kraju, którego nie widziałem na oczy przez przeszło 12 lat i udało mi się, z wieloma trudnościami, gigantycznymi na tyle, że potrafiłem Australię, Sydney, spoglądać przez szkliwo, peh, szkiełko, percepcję rozszerzoną na tyle, że gdy inni spoglądają na nią jak na raj, ja potrafiłem przejrzeć ją w całym skraju i przestrzeni, ale ukierunkowanej na negatyw.</p>

<p>Coś takiego jest, że będąc z dala od czegoś, można zacząć tego pragnieć, na tyle, że zaczynasz dostrzegać te niesamowitości. Ten element, który odróżnia, wyróżnia. No ale chuj. Wyruszyłem tam. Głowa mi wyparowała, nic, pustkowie w niej. Potem zaś musiałem odnaleźć się w brutalnej rzeczywistości, w której przyświecała mi jedyna taka idea, której nazewnictwo jest najprostsze i najbardziej naturalne na świecie - Wolność, bo do tego się wszystko sprowadza, co?</p>

<p>Po brutalnym pierwszym roku, nastał dobry kolejny. A po nim, absurdalny. Ale, życie chodzi w czwórkach, toteż, w zasadzie absurdalnym był też czwarty, a niesamowity trzeci. Dopiero w wieku 21 lat, w zasadzie spoglądając wstecz, mogę stwierdzić, że w zasadzie można bardzo wiele w życiu osiągnąć. W zasadzie niewielkim kosztem. Ale również dość sporym. Zależy przez jakie szkiełko spoglądać, bo można to wszystko obrócić do okoła, w gruncie rzeczy, dość małym wyzwaniem.</p>

      Zastanawiam się jak to będzie w przyszłości. Gdzie się widzisz w wieku 24? Wiesz co, pytanie gdzie wyląduję w wieku 24. Przekroczyłem już granice, teraz lewituję. Dokąd zmierzam, gdzie wyląduję? Życie jest śmieszne. Życie jest brutalne. Życie jest prawdziwe. Ale wiecie co? Może..</p>

<p>Może wyląduję jako geek, pracując w korporacji, odwalając robotę i ciesząc się ze swojego maluczkiego życia, krzycząc: I'm Freee! Kosztując standardowego australijskiego życia, będąc cząstką społ(eczności)eczeństwa, zizolowanego, zindoktrynowanego. Ale o czym ja teraz mówię? Raj na ziemi co? Nie wiem, z przewidywaniem przyszłości nigdy nie byłem dobry, w słowach, w ekspresji tego, co się nadarzy, bo w mojej głowie chaos, a w tym chaosie sie odnajduję i znajduję drogi, wyjscia takie, że absurd potrafię przetrawić w dobrą perspektywę. Ale jakim ja cudotwórcą, jakim bym nie był, tak może wyjść jak w pokerze.</p>

<p>Zyskałem więcej od wszystkich innych. Straciłem na końcu.
