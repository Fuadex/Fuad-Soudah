I've seen people having a pool built on their balconies. I've seen people having a barbecue on their rooftops (which you should REALLY not do!). I've seen people having sheeshas, creating their own feurzangenbowle.</p>

    <p>
      I was born in St. Leonards, Sydney in the land Down Under. I attended preschool and then the first year of my primary school. After which, my parents somewhat decided, to leave for Poland. These were 6 years of my life, the very start of a journey. There, the school's officers figured I'd be of more use if I went a year back, intead of skipping one ahead. For some reason, I did the entire 6 years in primary school. And then carried on with another 3 years in the very same building, yet under an equivalent system - secondary school. Thereof, I kind of bolted off to a high school that I were not necessarily after. Figuring that I would have no future nor perspectives in the country I just spent 12 years of my life, I used my joker that I got myself reissued a mere 2 years back, for which, surprisingly, I did and did not have to struggle for. The great endeavors of setting up an entirely new life and continuing my old yet came afloat, despite my best and at times lack of efforts. In the end, it didn't really seem that I was in charge of my own life after all. Bouncing off from the better to the unexpected best of the available to the then unforeseen choices that neither were of any significance nor could have been perceived as the adequate way forward. Yet I rolled in a certain direction. Successful in the unsuccess. As if I could conjure up the very real out of the very best from the ultimate mediocre of what was and is trivially called life.</p>

<p>2 years in Sydney. Filled with joy and struggle. Inertness with breaks for the pursuit of the impossible. I reached yet another destination that I was not exactly after. And yet it became the very best a person in my age could have ever received. I was placed in yet another limbo, to leave which all I had to do was take one step forward. Then I've taken two. And five. Even more, as I was required and then I kept on pushing, gently. To the point that I managed to build something stable with pure perspectives from here on out. Yet, I burried myself under an avalanche, tried to glide instead of taking steps. Once I succeeded, I had no clue what to do next. So I delivered a final push, precariously which this time left a gigantic toll. After recovering from which I then yet realised, then I realised despite my success, I have failed. And that was it. Two months before my exchange ends, I have massive obligations that I am bound to not meet. Once yet again, standing before a decision to find a way and try carrying out, carrying out one last push, raising a deliberate fantasy which would overlook the existing boundaries. At this point it seems possible. A feeling I might have experienced for the very first time not that long ago. Yet, there is no destination in mind. And that, y'all who've been reading this, is the reason for which I have created this website. Lick my wounds. Put everything into and in place. See perhaps if I could finally break free.

    <p>
I eventually managed to scrape off most of the materials that I have ever built, raised, created and cultivated. In the process, I recalled, finally, ablebodied to put together the crucial parts and a compelling, close to its true nature - a backstory. Every one and each, I believe has, or at the very least deserves a matching story. A little makeup. The tasty details. Sprinkled with insights. Embraced by myself and the magic that comes with.</p>

<p>My father is an overqualified Engineer. My mother is greatly skilled in Fine Arts.
I assume that I established myself a middle ground by binding technical and creative, ultimately becoming a designer.
And so I managed to acquire a broad selection of knowledges which on top was complemented with writing skills and a digital touch left upon.</p>

<p>The quality of works is of utmost importance and while the process follows or even matches, it is the circumstances in which the projects were raised that breathes and showcases its life. The inspirations, longings, design choices, thinking methods, all the processes, motivations. I did my best to foreclose all of the aforementioned and even more at the utmost of all the angles.

<p>
First of all, a common style was introduced on each subpage. My suggestion would be to take a peek at the Education subsection first, which upon investigating (clicking the unit of study), will take you to according subpages with the relevant projects that I have been working on in the past. Most of the materials will be interactive, that is, dependent on external materials such as: youtube and onedrive videos, onedrive presentations, documents and images, flickr images etc. I did my best to reference everyone that was involved in the group projects that I was involved in. If by any chance I happened to miss anyone, please notify me as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Each subpage will contain a backstory, the majority of which will be kept in professional manner. However, extra material will be included, that may shed some light onto the more creative ways that were applied into the creation process of a variety of projects.</p>

<p>Please take a look at my future (including current) projects on the navigation bar included below. A subpage with a list of changes ought to be attached as well. In case if you were trying to reach me, please find the Contact subpage in the top right corner. The cultural subpage will give you a sneakpeak into the cultural background that I was raised in.</p>

<p>I do hope that your stay on my website will be a pleasant one.</p>

    <p>I'm writing these words bound to a bed. Trying to figure out what should I do next, despite that I don't feel like doing anything, except, I would love to get back to doing, just as much, literally, anything.</p>

<p>Few words of wisdom: finally, I've derailed. That's right, you're reading it correctly. Fuad got eventually and literally blown away. I wouldn't get as far as to say torn to pieces, but would consider it unfair that my mind was in shambles and still actually is. Lately I liked the idea of considering myself as a tank. You know I tried changing this outlook, right? But in fact, I went straight back to square one, as if I was playing Antichamber and after having gone in great lengths, well almighty, I'm back to where I was. Just, now I've got an amnesia or Alzheimer's. Well, any of these and while I'm overstating, there is still some truth to it and you probably know there is (as well).</p>

<p>So what a tank does is, it moves forward. It may take some time, it might run out of fuel, but the machine will likely</p>

And in the midst and highlight? Getting stirred up with deadlines, pushing me and squeezing, instantly squarifiying and making a solid paste of glue stuck into the wall. With no room to go, say, think or act. Any living space. All squeezed and crushed down.</p>

<p>Discontent with life. Despite all the successes, ridiculous. As if they were Pyrrhic victories, but they were not, just simply, yet, victories!</p>

<p>Potentially and heavily hit, from multiple sides, mainly my own, internal, from within. Bombarded and working on multiple vectors, to get out, run, chase down something in the horizon, something that I wanted, to create an aim, refashion the target. Make it visible, hunt it down, hunt it down! Down! Up! Left! Back! Within? In another dimension perhaps?</p>

<p>Doing all the travels and running, away from myself, my own, my mental, psychological states and minds, from all the problems, making rounds, making space, trying to push myself ahead, make room inside my head, inspire, touch, create and visit the uncharted, space it out, cultivate and, revitalize it.</p>

<p>Initiate a sequence, with which I would be able to complete the impossible. Something out of reach, but yet, I was already living the dream, that I knew was real, but how it became what it became? It had to find a wall, hit hard, bury me underneath all the ridiculous and the rubble of thoughts and myself. Falling apart or being apart, being the rubble itself, personifying this state.</p>

<p>It certainly took it toll on me.<br>
It released its' toll on me.<br>

    <p>
      I don't know how I did it. I don't know how I survived it. I'm at a loss.</p>

<p>Despite all the ridiculous. Despite all the irrational. I need to stop. Take a look at my inner inventory. Find if I actually did get so far. And how much 'till I'll actually find my peace.</p>



<p>In fact there was much more to the story. I got an extra bonus 9 points for my projects for MMI2, in which I thought I'd lose everything. The exercises themselves? I did pretty much all of them last minute, relatively diligently. The trick was? For the main exercises, instead of being a part of a larger team (up to 4 people!) I did everything alone. Last minute. And still got a total o 9 points. That's just a mere example.</p>


<p>The question remains? What next. I have pretty much 4 months left on this continent. And there are a number of problems that I will need to face, better earlier than never than later than... well, ever. Which makes absolutely no sense but none of it does anymore.</p>

<p>Inwentaryzacja.</p>

<p>A magic clusterfuck inside your brain that makes all the magic.
And make things where they're supposed to be.</p>
