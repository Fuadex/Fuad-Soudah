Propositions:</p>

<p>The largest issue encompassing Olympiadorf is the fact that newcomers actually need to make an effort in order to socialize and become part of the entire village as a whole. While it is true, that students have other chores from day to day such as primarily university itself and usually work in order to be able to make a living and afford, still extremely affordable, student housing, especially considering the qualities it delivers and provides the students with, makes the entire living there part something that seems even hard to believe once you try clarifying it to someone from the outside.

    <br>

    <p>
I propose the following:<br>
- A tutor who would coordinate in conjunction with studentenwerk the integration of newcomers, whether exchange, domestic or international students.<br>
- The tutor would get reimbursed similarly to today's 80 Euros for his/her work, but involving the newcomers to the village<br>
- The integration would take place via the internet, through which evaluation would take place by the newcomers of the area. It would be a one-way evaluation, which would take each semester for the first 3 semesters<br>
- There would be an utmost of 26 tutors in case of the bungalows. One per row.<br>
- The tutors responsible for more people would be reimbursed higher compared to the others, the value would equal around 10 Euros per person, allocated to the tutor only in the case if the tutor manages to integrate the newcomer in the programs, that equals 3 Euros per semester per person who takes part in the programs. So: between 72 Euros to 168 Euros<br>
- Bonuses for being able to integrate: 75%, 85%, 95% and 100% of the students, equal by an equivalent multiplier: 1,15, 1,3, 1,5 and 1,8.<br>
- The allocated money will have to go: in 75% towards the dwellers, in 25% towards the tutor himself<br>
- The tutors get elected via 3rd party means, that is a different system in which each vote directed is concealed (nobody knows who voted for whom)<br>
- 12 Haussprecher located in the old bungalow buildings<br>
- Responsible for matters that need to be mediated in between the students and the studentenwerk<br>
- Needs to be within reach 24/7, each bungalow dweller gets assigned a personal one<br>
- The Haussprecher will be evaluated by the end of each semester, based on their performance, they will receive an according amount of money: 3 Euros per person<br>
- Bonus system: 75% - 1.15, 85% - 1.3%, 95% - 1.5, 100% - 1.8<br>
- If the reputation drops below 65%, the housesprecher will crease to be one and a new election will have to take place<br>
- On top of that, haussprecher will be allocated an additional amount of money equal to 1 Euro per person. The money will have to be directed towards revitalizing a certain part of the village, that could be a garden part, or a form of streetworkout. The idea will need to be communicated via electronic means and the minimum of 3 ideas will need to be introduced. Studentenwerk will be able to intervene in case if an idea seems way off<br>
- The president and two vicepresidents may be elected only by the dwellers who have been in Olydorf for longer than 3 semesters in total. Their duty will be to represent the Olympic Village beyond it and spearhead the general direction of how the village will evolve. New developments will need to be discussed between Studentenwerk and the (vice)presidents and hence by them announced to the community. Haussprecher will need to report to the (vice)presidents the needs and adjustments in case of such projects. Furthermore, (vice)presidents will only be eligible to become such once they go through the entire system from bottom up, that is: tutor, haussprecher and then potentially (vice)presidents.<br>
- The only way to take down (vice)presidents will be through a combination of votes, which will be allocated to: studentenwerk as an organisation, majority of haussprecher and majority of tutors. In case if a bid for repeal of (vice)presidents fails, they will still need to step down after the end of the term nevertheless. The maximum term for (vice)presidents will be just 2.<br>
- The treasurer will be allocated by studentenwerk itself, who's responsibility will be to allocate the money to the tutors, haussprecher and (vice)presidents. Additionally, he/she will monitor the progress made each division of Olydorf. The duties will be strictly limited to just accounting, with an extra personal report view made confidentially to studentenwerk and (vice)presidents, who may publish it under circumstances in which potential unlawful decisions might have been undertaken<br>
- The treasurer will have to be a student in Olydorf, who's specialization in which he/she will be majoring in will be related to accounting<br>
- The (vice)presidents will receive in total of 1% of the total Olydorf's income, which will need to be directed at least at 90% towards ideas and works scheduled around Olydorf. The remaining 3%, 2% and 2% will go towards the (vice)presidents. The remaining 3% will be stored as collateral for any potential mishandling and 2% donated towards travel expenses in case of Olydorf's promotion

Ausschusses</p>
<p>
- Each ausschuss will be evaluated by the community itself, gaining votes for either doing the job properly or not<br>
- The participation in an ausschuss will lower the rent by 5 Euros and increase by 5 for each semester a student participates in. The deal does not multiply by participating in more than 1 ausschuss (so basically one person per one ausschuss)<br>
- Participating in an ausschuss that is relevant according to the studies being undertaken by a student will automatically prolong their stay for every two semesters participated (and gained a total of minimum 65% of the community's satisfaction)<br>
- Who becomes the head of the ausschuss is the solely matter of the ausschusss' themselves. The head will have to step down once the community's satisfaction drops under 65%. The stay at olydorf gets prolonged for each semester for the head of an ausschuss. Maximum term of 2 semesters, unless the satisfactory rate reaches 85% for the second semester and 95% for third. If the satisfactory rate keeps up at 95%, the head may stay as long as it stays equal or over 95%.

<p>
Exchange Students</p>
<p>
- Special evaluation directed towards them, who will be able to introduce their ideas and rate how each part of the village works. Their input may change the multiplier attached to haussprecher and tutors by: 1% if positive, -0.5% if none, -1.5% if negative. A satisfaction rate under 75% will result in the repeal of the according tutor, and under 70% will repeal the haussprecher allocated to the exchange students (in regards to exchange students)</p>

<p>
Bungalows</p>
<p>
- The rooftops will be now repurposed for the students to be used socially, with benches established, gardens and whatever is needed and decided by the rows of students.<br>
- A garden will be established on the back of Olydorf</p>

<p>
Mensa</p>
<p>
- A Mensacafe will be established on top of the current Mensa, in which most employment possibilities will be offered for the students (the place will be run by studentenwerk, though). During the day, it will offer breakfasts and lunches. On evenings it will be a cafe available for everyone (lack of cheap and/or high volume alcohol).</p>

      Afterwards, we went to Vistula to see if we could get my pants repaired. We couldn't, but were told that if we had the receipt, then it's possible. Well, my mom found the receipt eventually. So that may get fixed soon.</p>

<p>We went to get some pączki, which were okay, but not necessarily my type (standard, yet fresh, but I prefer nicely fried).</p>

<p>Then, we went to pick up a pair of IEMs, Custom Art's FIBAE1. I have decided, that instead of buying a pair of IEM's every damn half a year, I'd buy a proper one. Turned out, there is one collective (?), company (?), person(s) (?), who are really into what they do. And they do custom IEM's. For the previous pair of Philips Fidelio S2 I got a refund. So I got myself that one for -10%, with a mic and recessed intakes. Picked them up after 4-5 weeks. Got myself the entire set. And now I'm burning them out. Perfect isolation. Great quality of sound (still testing). Extremely content at the moment.</p>

<p>On top of that, my mom decided to buy me 2 new shirts.</p>

<p>So? I'm back. Scarred and wretched but back. With my equipment and mindset, I feel I could accomplish amazing things once again.</p>

<p>EDIT: The IEMs at the moment seem to play a notch unbalanced. At times the highs are squeeky, at times they are just flat. It seems they behave better on my S7 rather than on my note 3 or my laptop. I just presume it's a matter of burning out.

And in the midst and highlight? Getting stirred up with deadlines, pushing me and squeezing, instantly squarifiying and making a solid paste of glue stuck into the wall. With no room to go, say, think or act. Any living space. All squeezed and crushed down.</p>

<p>Discontent with life. Despite all the successes, ridiculous. As if they were Pyrrhic victories, but they were not, just simply, yet, victories!</p>

<p>Potentially and heavily hit, from multiple sides, mainly my own, internal, from within. Bombarded and working on multiple vectors, to get out, run, chase down something in the horizon, something that I wanted, to create an aim, refashion the target. Make it visible, hunt it down, hunt it down! Down! Up! Left! Back! Within? In another dimension perhaps?</p>

<p>Doing all the travels and running, away from myself, my own, my mental, psychological states and minds, from all the problems, making rounds, making space, trying to push myself ahead, make room inside my head, inspire, touch, create and visit the uncharted, space it out, cultivate and, revitalize it.</p>

<p>Initiate a sequence, with which I would be able to complete the impossible. Something out of reach, but yet, I was already living the dream, that I knew was real, but how it became what it became? It had to find a wall, hit hard, bury me underneath all the ridiculous and the rubble of thoughts and myself. Falling apart or being apart, being the rubble itself, personifying this state.</p>

      I don't know how I did it. I don't know how I survived it. I'm at a loss.</p>

<p>Despite all the ridiculous. Despite all the irrational. I need to stop. Take a look at my inner inventory. Find if I actually did get so far. And how much 'till I'll actually find my peace.</p>



<p>In fact there was much more to the story. I got an extra bonus 9 points for my projects for MMI2, in which I thought I'd lose everything. The exercises themselves? I did pretty much all of them last minute, relatively diligently. The trick was? For the main exercises, instead of being a part of a larger team (up to 4 people!) I did everything alone. Last minute. And still got a total o 9 points. That's just a mere example.</p>


<p>The question remains? What next. I have pretty much 4 months left on this continent. And there are a number of problems that I will need to face, better earlier than never than later than... well, ever. Which makes absolutely no sense but none of it does anymore.</p>

<p>Inwentaryzacja.</p>

<p>A magic clusterfuck inside your brain that makes all the magic.
And make things where they're supposed to be.</p>
