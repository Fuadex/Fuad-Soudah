So let me just say a few words about the situation in which I was placed in for the past 1-2 months.</p>

<p>First of all, I went to Italy. In which I thought I'd get robbed and I almost did get robbed (but then didn't). I went to Poland for easter and then back to Munich to discover that my bike is gone. I might have even seen it a week ago and tried reporting it but the police in Munich didn't give a single fuck, having said that I should have called immediately. I was out of reach on whatsapp so nobody gave a damn about notifying me about anything regarding the committee I was in. Furthermore, same went for one group I am doing a project with, now it even turns out that I will have to change groups because of the practical tutorial allocation.</p>

<p>I didn't have any internet. I didn't have a bicycle. I didn't make a semester ticket. I didn't have much of anything to hold on to. I didn't even top up my bank account, the card on which it operates will conclude within this month. I didn't pay attention to the lectures because I was working on a website that I figured could put everything into place, but it kind of didn't (though turned out relatively nice). Now take note, all of these nothings were taking too long, 5 weeks of web development, before 3 weeks of inertness takes a total of 8 weeks that were purely wasted. Now I finally managed to somehow get over it and figured that I have a shitstorm approaching with a number of deadlines basically hitting me every day and each.

     Now, while I managed to set up some sort of a mobile connection eventually, I still were derived (?) from the real world. Surprisingly, I was able to sort almost all of my problems within a single day spent near Warsaw.</p>

<p>First of all, I took a bus from Munich to Wrocław. I took part in a barbeque that did not take part. After which a few decided to paint a bungalow and I hit the road. From Munich to Wrocław by bus. Had a problem that I came across an information that the bus would go to Warsaw but it didn't. Anyway, arrived in Wrocław. From there I had to take the expensive option and go by pendolino to Warsaw. I left at 23:55 from Munich. Arrived at 18:00 in Warsaw. Arrived 2 km from my home. Went to a church fair. Got caught in the midst of a heavy rain. Then still took part and arrived at home. Soaked boots. Not soaked backpack (as my australian coat still works relatively like a charm). I ate. Spent some time with my family. Worked on a deadline. Unfortunately missed a concert held by a friend of mine. But I arrived at his place, had some absinthe (what's wrong with me?). Then had some beer for the next hour. Tried translating my friend's polish speech and had some interesting talks.</p>

<p>The next day was the most interesting part, though.
I woke up at 7. Took a shower, but as usual I couldn't comb my hair. I worked afterwards on a metal article, which I did last minute on almost 2.5 pages, sort of blindfolded. I worked on it until 8 and then had breakfast at my mom's place. Yesterday was a great salad, steamed mushrooms in a spicy sauce, rice, avocado and a green, sweet melon. Today, was some cheese, cherry tomatoes, more melon and coffee afterwards.

    <center><h4>Critical Dillema</h4></center>
    
    <p>
We went to receive my phone around 9. I gave my Galaxy S7, as I was insured for any mishandling on my end, that is, dropping my phone which I unfortunately did a while back. There were a few problems with handling it. The courier would not arrive so my mom gave it in person. Then they would not repair the thing until we accepted a fee for the back of the phone. I decided it was okay, so we proceeded. Then, same thing happened again, now just with the phone's camera. My mom might have agreed. Then when she tried receiving it, it turned out that the system issuing receipt was dead (perhaps... wannacry malware? ;) ) It took them a week and then turned out it was okay to be received. We went there. And a few interesting things have surfaced. First of all, not only the phone's back was fixed. Everything was fixed. We were issued with three separate papers: insurer's billing, warranty's fixes and the one we got charged with fixes. However, they even did some stuff around the phone's motherboard (and hence all my data is gone). And so: the screen was changed, some parts of the case were changed, following paper: some parts of the case were changed, of the motherboard (!) and the usb connector, next paper: changes in the case. It looks like a new phone, it works flawlessly, they even fixed the volume down button that got damaged by some way. And they didn't bill us additionally afterwards, for the camera case (for some reason). My mom even received a lindt chocolate pralines because of the problem with receiving the phone a week ago. In the end we paid 170 PLN (~60 AU$) in total. And the phone is like new.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we went to the commune to get my id. I never received an email regarding whether it was done or not so I was a little fed up. My grandma called them 4 weeks I applied and they said it was ready. So I went there and... how surprised I was upon the discovery of the date on which my ID was issued. Just the day after I supplied my documents via the internet... The photo of which I took myself (actually my mom did, I did the postprocessing). The old ID was cut across. I had to just sign a document that I received my ID. I don't even look that much of a criminal on it, lolz. And I was asked whether I, basically, have a business or not. I'm a student. So it was: have a nice day and bye! By the way quite a few people were around the commune today... Someday it will become big.

Then we went home. Had some coffee and more melon. And took a train to Warsaw, the central station. One of the other things I managed to damage was supposed indestructible leather shoes. Apparently a pair that can't be cut up. Can't be burnt. Can't get soaked. Somehow, a stitching managed to burst out. And they agreed to get them fixed only after 2 weeks have passed. My mom was pretty fed up and made a few oversaturated comments. Eventually agreeing with the stirred up cashier that she would call my mom to sort out whether and when will the shoes get ready.</p>

<p>We went into Saturn, before Euro AGD. I asked whether they had AAAA batteries. They said that nope and perhaps the competition might have. Saturn had, 3 złotys more expensive than how it was on their website. But it was the last piece so I bought it as I needed it to do some work for a few coming up deadlines and my surface pen ran out of juice (just when I needed it!). 12 złotys for it. Bought it, was asked whether i'd like to have a frequent buyer's card, said nope. Then got a phone that the shoes are being in repair. That we'd know how are they by tomorrow at 5, when I'd no longer be in Warsaw. Having noticed that were was an actual pair still in the shop, I asked whether it could be possible to just exchange the pair of shoes. We were told to make a visit.</p>

<p>This time, it turned out different. We were apologized for the situations, told that it was beyond their power. I asked if they had the same shoes and pointed out at the model. Turned out they did, just not in the same size: 45,5. They had 46, though. So I put them on. Turned out, they were perfect. So we decided to go forward with the replacement. I tried leading the conversation now, more of a balanced and considerate. We used a loyality card and it turned out, that the shoes were on a discount now. So, we were told that we can't have the remainder of the money, although we could get something to match the price. So I got myself a small bag, perfect for a DSLR. After the discounted pricing, we acquired it for the mere price of 15 PLN. Seems like a solid choice. Got a better matched pair of shoes. Got myself a bag for a DSLR. Extra 2 years of warranty. Perfect, ain't it?</p>

      Afterwards, we went to Vistula to see if we could get my pants repaired. We couldn't, but were told that if we had the receipt, then it's possible. Well, my mom found the receipt eventually. So that may get fixed soon.</p>

<p>We went to get some pączki, which were okay, but not necessarily my type (standard, yet fresh, but I prefer nicely fried).</p>

<p>Then, we went to pick up a pair of IEMs, Custom Art's FIBAE1. I have decided, that instead of buying a pair of IEM's every damn half a year, I'd buy a proper one. Turned out, there is one collective (?), company (?), person(s) (?), who are really into what they do. And they do custom IEM's. For the previous pair of Philips Fidelio S2 I got a refund. So I got myself that one for -10%, with a mic and recessed intakes. Picked them up after 4-5 weeks. Got myself the entire set. And now I'm burning them out. Perfect isolation. Great quality of sound (still testing). Extremely content at the moment.</p>

<p>On top of that, my mom decided to buy me 2 new shirts.</p>

<p>So? I'm back. Scarred and wretched but back. With my equipment and mindset, I feel I could accomplish amazing things once again.</p>

<p>EDIT: The IEMs at the moment seem to play a notch unbalanced. At times the highs are squeeky, at times they are just flat. It seems they behave better on my S7 rather than on my note 3 or my laptop. I just presume it's a matter of burning out.

And in the midst and highlight? Getting stirred up with deadlines, pushing me and squeezing, instantly squarifiying and making a solid paste of glue stuck into the wall. With no room to go, say, think or act. Any living space. All squeezed and crushed down.</p>

<p>Discontent with life. Despite all the successes, ridiculous. As if they were Pyrrhic victories, but they were not, just simply, yet, victories!</p>

<p>Potentially and heavily hit, from multiple sides, mainly my own, internal, from within. Bombarded and working on multiple vectors, to get out, run, chase down something in the horizon, something that I wanted, to create an aim, refashion the target. Make it visible, hunt it down, hunt it down! Down! Up! Left! Back! Within? In another dimension perhaps?</p>

<p>Doing all the travels and running, away from myself, my own, my mental, psychological states and minds, from all the problems, making rounds, making space, trying to push myself ahead, make room inside my head, inspire, touch, create and visit the uncharted, space it out, cultivate and, revitalize it.</p>

<p>Initiate a sequence, with which I would be able to complete the impossible. Something out of reach, but yet, I was already living the dream, that I knew was real, but how it became what it became? It had to find a wall, hit hard, bury me underneath all the ridiculous and the rubble of thoughts and myself. Falling apart or being apart, being the rubble itself, personifying this state.</p>

<p>.</p>

    <p>
      I don't know how I did it. I don't know how I survived it. I'm at a loss.</p>

<p>Despite all the ridiculous. Despite all the irrational. I need to stop. Take a look at my inner inventory. Find if I actually did get so far. And how much 'till I'll actually find my peace.</p>



<p>In fact there was much more to the story. I got an extra bonus 9 points for my projects for MMI2, in which I thought I'd lose everything. The exercises themselves? I did pretty much all of them last minute, relatively diligently. The trick was? For the main exercises, instead of being a part of a larger team (up to 4 people!) I did everything alone. Last minute. And still got a total o 9 points. That's just a mere example.</p>


<p>The question remains? What next. I have pretty much 4 months left on this continent. And there are a number of problems that I will need to face, better earlier than never than later than... well, ever. Which makes absolutely no sense but none of it does anymore.</p>

<p>Inwentaryzacja.</p>

And make things where they're supposed to be.</p>
