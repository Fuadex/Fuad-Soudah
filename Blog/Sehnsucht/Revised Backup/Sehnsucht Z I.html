      As of late, I have an impression that I am everyone. And that I can become anyone and try forming into any form. Once I heard that one needs to specialise, be the best in something. As even though if you try to be good in everything, you won't be good at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be honest, in my case I think that didn't quite make the cut, although even such form of wisdoms can be iterated upon. Although, one may honestly say, that if I can be anyone, then I am nobody. Also as a person, who is a nobody.

  In the last couple of days I've been thinking a lot. In relation to thinking there is lots of assumptions that arise, often all fogged up.
</p>

<p>
  Lately I've been living very fast. I tried even faster, chasing the rabbit, which does not exist. Only projections, evasive. While my response seems like a bit... straightforward.
</p>

<p>
  Not that long ago I utilised a quite interesting mechanism. I settled that, well, fuck it. I'll try. In the sea of overinterpretation and scarred mental state pushed me in the state of inebriation to actions that in the end I've never ever completed. After which, although fairly uninteligible negative, put me on towards an euphoric state.
</p>

<p>
  I forgot to take some steps. It'd be a good idea to do them first, as I just marked a huge slump and landed with my face right at the ground.

    <p>
      Funny thing. Lately I'm feeling like an ass. I woke up dead-drunk after 4 beers and a few shots of soplica orzechowa (nutty liquour). When I went to my bathroom, I noticed a stack of envelopes. When I went again to sleep, dazzled, I noticed my bed was made. I also checked, my pillow was in its case but my quilt wasn't. Then my second pillow was in a T-shirt.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few days ago I went on a spontaneous trip to Lublana. In order, I started from the end, in this case I began with Zagreb, as that turned out just simply cheaper. Last minute, I sprang out of my place and yet I arrived at the bus hub 45 minutes before departure. Financially, in the end I made ends meet. I took a photo in Lublana, by hand, with a DSLR, which after a mild post-processing action was liked by 55 people, although it wasn't a profile picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not that long ago I played poker, in which I had as a matter of fact more chips than all the other players combined. I have no idea how I lost, other players also didn't know but I managed to pay off my beers, although I still feel hurt by this loss, I still figured that everything went sideways.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yesterday I got an email that I just got into a course, in which the key thing is programming. In which case, this particular course I had to do, as in Australia I would have to do it but I wouldn't need to know programming at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the morning I saw a movie, which blew me out into the cosmos, yet I still feel quite tipsy, aesthetics the alcohol ghost cannot take away and a masterpiece I may call it straightaway, by fishing out a sea of nuances and metaphors, so great and so ideally presented.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could probably continue like this. And I will.

    <p>
      Within last year, I managed to see more than in my entire rest of my life. Within last year I managed to lose 20 kg, which could be considered an accomplishment, although, honestly. I managed to go on exchange to Munich. And you know what? If I was to name the circumstances in which I was dispatched in here, it's just one thing that comes to my mind - scandalous. But remember, I already said that I'm saying everything the other way around.
    </p>

    <p>
      I even began reading books. Oh yes. Bradbury got pinched. Huxley underway. I even managed to go through the carrousel of transitions and experiences and admitting: I'm Freee! Although, am I? I even became a sort of an abstinent, one of a kind, I transffered, although I can see the effects already, here and now.
    </p>

      Dear all, I could carry on like this but I'll say as much. Life ain't fair.

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

    <p>
      A slice of my life. How beautiful, eh? Honestly, I thought that at the age of 18 I would be an adult already. In fact there ain't anything that say anything against, everything's in order, at the age of 18 I jumped to the other part of the world and I settled in a country, which I haven't seen for the last 12 years and I made it with great difficulties, so gigantic that I managed to see Australia, Sydney, through the lens of, eh, extended perception to the point that others look at it as a paradise yet I managed to see through it all and see it in a quite negative form.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is something, that while being away from something you may yearn for this so much that you begin to see all its amaze. This element, which makes it unique, different, well, anyway I went out. My head just went up in smoke, nothing, anything left. Then I had to find myself in a brutal world in which there was only one idea that set in front, of which name is the plainest and most natural in the world - freedom, as it all comes down to this, heh.
    </p>

    <p>
      After my first year, there was another a good one that followed. And then again there was an absurd one. But life goes in fours. So I could figure, the absurd one is also four and incredible three. Once I become 21, in fact looking back I may say that in fact that there is a lot that one can achieve. IN fact with very little. Yet also quite big endeavour. It depends through which lens you'd look through as one can shift it all around and in fact, with little effort.

    <p>
      I wonder how it's going to be in the future. Where will I see myself at the age of 24? You know what, the question of where I will end up at 24. I already surpassed a boundary, now I'm levitating. Where I'm going, where I'm about to end up in? Life is funny. Life is brutal. Life is true. But you know what? Perhaps...
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps I'll end up as a geek, working at a corporation, working my ass off and being happy about my little life screaming 'I'm Freee!'. Being content with the standard australian life, being a part of the society, isolated, indoctrinated. But what am I talking about now? Paradise on earth eh? I don't know, I'm not good with foreseeing the future I never was great at it, with words, with expressions of what will happen as in my head there is chaos and in this chaos I may find myself and find my way towards the exit of sort that an absurd can digest a great perspective. Yet what sort of a miraclemaker am I, whatever the sort I wouldn't be, that's how it may turn out in poker.

      II managed to achieve more than everyone else. I lost later on.
