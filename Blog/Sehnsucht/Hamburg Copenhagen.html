      ICE train reached the station 15 minutes before the planned arrival. I got lectured by a police car on how to cross a road and shifted from a dangerously looking central station area to a shanty town, or should I call it: shanty city, as nothing was left open so late in the night and... merely anyone was left parading the streets.</p>

<p>And of those who were left, middle-eastern and african figures around the hauptbahnhof (central station) area, some germans in distress, needing a lighter (didn't have one) and needing water (did have some)... and perhaps some homeless, twitching left and or right, sleeping in different corners.</p>

<p>Oh, *niff* *niff*, is it, that I'm smelling weed now? Strange, city center, righr next to a shopping center. Although nobody was present, miraculous clouds of astonishment.</p>

<p>After this one of a kind introduction, a few words in awe of Frankfurt. It's actually a spacious city, quite different to its german nephews, as, yes it does have a city centrr, but it's more spaced out throughout the city. And still it's not compact, so it may take ~2-3h to see it all. And it's a shame that I showed up do late cause there is actually plenty to be seen. History and landmark-wise, not only churches but also quaint and elaborately painted buildings aka architecturewise it's a nice hike to take for and of course, the modern part is a wow factor as well.</p>

<p>Look, if anybody asked me of how I imagined Munich would look like, I'd happily provide a picture of Frankfurt. You name it: skyscrapers, parks or... hold on, I'm describing Sydney now, am I not? Okay, but it still fits the description, that's how I imagined that it would be. And Frankfurt? Well, just yet another boring city. Turned out surprisingly contradictionary and well, there are tons to see her, especially during daylight. And the amount of museums is just staggering. But the business centres built around lovely parks. Wow, well, we've got some utopia brewing are we not?

      Although I did not know that much to begin with and considered the trip as a, well, trip to the outskirts of the EU, could be fun, could be interesting, perhaps the same as in any other country? One might have thought. And I actually considered heading to Lublana first, as a combination of trips, laid out throughout the last couple of, still relatively free days, trying to make the best of what I still had little of time, before my exam-month alarm finally goes off and so would I. Also, the clock is ticking and the winter won't last forever, therefore, I ought to see at least a bit of what I may, before all the snow melts away.</p>

<p>Anyway, just yet another blitz, go, see as much shit, head back, become richer with a new experience and learn a chunk more. Ljubljana turned as second and I have doubts, whether it should have as the city I stumbled upon, grew very fast on me. Although I did start off the wrong foot, eventually it might have actually become my favorite East European city. I did have this resemblance, a quite surprisingly matching one, of a princedom called Toussaint, from 'The Witcher' book series. Despite a french-like name, if I could picture such a fairy-tale city, a reflection could be sought in Ljubljana.</p>

<p>A city encompassed by vast chains of mountains. Built on lowlands but with a castle, right on a sturdy hill, overlooking the entire region. Untouched by wars. Flourishing. Crimson tiles. Semi-logically planned infrastructure outline. In the background clearly visible mountain peaks of the Alps, turning pinky-rouge as the sundown advanced. Surprisingly well invested, with new infrastructure being developed in a clearly modern fashion. Clean and designed mixing well with the environment.

     Although at first my impressions were distorted by the gruesome outlook of the train/bus station and afterwards the people of Ljubljana, who seemed egocentric, rushing one way or another, not giving a single, two fucks about the others, once I reached the actual center of the city, it seemed so peaceful. Especially around the castle area, but the beauty was easily intercepted. A handful of beautifully kept, well maintained bridges. Alike and in harmony with the area. Trimmed trees, symmetrically spaced along the river. Stylish, subtly colorful, rather minimal but old style, romanian (?) architecture. A mix of international brands' storefronts and single businesses', which blended together quite nicely, minimal and well designed brands.</p>

<p>I was incredibly rushing as I had merely just 3 hours to spend in the city. The compact nature of the city center helped notoriously, but as my roaming aldi prepaid failed and so did the power outlets in the bus I took, both, from Munich to Zagreb and from Zagreb to Ljubljana, I had to charge my phone (12%!) and buy a ticket back to Munich. How do I manage that in a city I don't know and even without a google maps outline of the city? I was entirely blind and had just one idea in my head: find a university. No power outlets at the train station either. Strange wifi and purchasing anything through it would be a death sentence, so bam I marched ahead, figuring that perhaps, well, 'that could be south', lol. I was right. I reached the university. Plugged myself in and used Eduroam. Finally I knew where I was and my orientation skills worked as a marvel this time alone. But I squandered around 20 minutes. Oh, did I say I squandered 20 minutes? Well, triple/quadruple that I spent in the castle area. That's right, the tranquility, the pleasure of experiencing the sunset and... peace and beauty.

There were surprisingly quite a lot of tourists, which gave a very international outlook to the city itself. Despite Slovenia being relatively quite low-key, I underestimated what I was about to see. But the interesting thing is, for the western countries, Slovenia could actually be a very tempting destination. I mean, they've got the Euro currency there. And apart from that, it's very cheap. Seriously cheap. Which didn't make much sense, but the hell I know. Unfortunately and sadly I didn't have enough time to experience any local dishes, but I did try a Burek, which cost 2 Euros and did a last-minute grocery shopping with 5 items (sweets, drinks) enclosing the bill within 5 Euros. That's a quite decent outcome if you ask me. Oh and the bus got late by half an hour. Probably the bus got stranded at the border, again. But at least the power outlets were up and working.</p>

<p>I'm kind of trying to come up with new ideas of what I could potentially say about this city. It's really fairytalish and I gotta say that I wouldn't have anything against spending there an entire day. There's not much, meaning tons to see, as merely 250.000 people live there, but it's got a knack to it and the beauty is just marvel, truly irresistible. Great destination to wind down and just feel the environment. Oh and there are some surprises in the city, as a friend recommended a specific street, which felt like: nah, okay, it's alright, but then once I marched in. Well, 'you feel like you're about to get robbed', was the sentence used I believe. As if one gigantic squat, but seriously one of a kind one. Graffiti all over the place. It's funny, because of all this rigid looking, worn down environment, it was a neighbor to a, seems like newly built, modern, humongous combination of university buildings (?). Oh wait, these were actually museums. And the squat-like area had a neighbor of the ministry of culture. How queer.

    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      Wycinek z mojego życia. Jakże piękny, co? Szczerze, myślałem, że w wieku 18 lat już stanę się dorosły. W zasadzie to nie ma tu nic przeciw, wszystko się zgadza, w wieku 18 lat wypierdoliłem na drugi skraj ziemi, usadowiłem się w kraju, którego nie widziałem na oczy przez przeszło 12 lat i udało mi się, z wieloma trudnościami, gigantycznymi na tyle, że potrafiłem Australię, Sydney, spoglądać przez szkliwo, peh, szkiełko, percepcję rozszerzoną na tyle, że gdy inni spoglądają na nią jak na raj, ja potrafiłem przejrzeć ją w całym skraju i przestrzeni, ale ukierunkowanej na negatyw.</p>

<p>Coś takiego jest, że będąc z dala od czegoś, można zacząć tego pragnieć, na tyle, że zaczynasz dostrzegać te niesamowitości. Ten element, który odróżnia, wyróżnia. No ale chuj. Wyruszyłem tam. Głowa mi wyparowała, nic, pustkowie w niej. Potem zaś musiałem odnaleźć się w brutalnej rzeczywistości, w której przyświecała mi jedyna taka idea, której nazewnictwo jest najprostsze i najbardziej naturalne na świecie - Wolność, bo do tego się wszystko sprowadza, co?</p>

<p>Po brutalnym pierwszym roku, nastał dobry kolejny. A po nim, absurdalny. Ale, życie chodzi w czwórkach, toteż, w zasadzie absurdalnym był też czwarty, a niesamowity trzeci. Dopiero w wieku 21 lat, w zasadzie spoglądając wstecz, mogę stwierdzić, że w zasadzie można bardzo wiele w życiu osiągnąć. W zasadzie niewielkim kosztem. Ale również dość sporym. Zależy przez jakie szkiełko spoglądać, bo można to wszystko obrócić do okoła, w gruncie rzeczy, dość małym wyzwaniem.</p>

      Zastanawiam się jak to będzie w przyszłości. Gdzie się widzisz w wieku 24? Wiesz co, pytanie gdzie wyląduję w wieku 24. Przekroczyłem już granice, teraz lewituję. Dokąd zmierzam, gdzie wyląduję? Życie jest śmieszne. Życie jest brutalne. Życie jest prawdziwe. Ale wiecie co? Może..</p>

<p>Może wyląduję jako geek, pracując w korporacji, odwalając robotę i ciesząc się ze swojego maluczkiego życia, krzycząc: I'm Freee! Kosztując standardowego australijskiego życia, będąc cząstką społ(eczności)eczeństwa, zizolowanego, zindoktrynowanego. Ale o czym ja teraz mówię? Raj na ziemi co? Nie wiem, z przewidywaniem przyszłości nigdy nie byłem dobry, w słowach, w ekspresji tego, co się nadarzy, bo w mojej głowie chaos, a w tym chaosie sie odnajduję i znajduję drogi, wyjscia takie, że absurd potrafię przetrawić w dobrą perspektywę. Ale jakim ja cudotwórcą, jakim bym nie był, tak może wyjść jak w pokerze.</p>

<p>Zyskałem więcej od wszystkich innych. Straciłem na końcu.
