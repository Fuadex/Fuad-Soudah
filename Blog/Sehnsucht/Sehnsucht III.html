<p>
  Education? Happiness? Freedom? So many different concepts I've been introducing myself throughout last couple of years of my life, attempting to explain what motivates me to further actions. 'Nothing's impossible', perhaps perpetually returning, in fact course of events, which only recalls these words back and back and back... And despite, that I was riding all the time in a broken circle, attempting the very same mistakes, returning psychologically to the states, in which I already was, to repeat exactly the same mental scenarios, which I already have completed. Munich... Funny thing. If anyone mentioned of Germany, I'd respond I always wanted to end up in Munich. To make a trip, because it's a metropolis. How wrong was I.

<p>
  I should probably mention at this stage, that I'm finding amusing a couple of things. It might be the case that I failed to mention a few things as they might have just simply not happened just yet, this was merely just the first week, interestingly and tons were already happening, which was a definitely good indication of where this exchange was heading and turning. I'm not 100% sure about the EHIC thing but I think I failed to mention a key component of this voyage that lead me straight into the main building of LMU. It might be the case, that it was actually a bit earlier at Giselastrasse, where I was sorting out my stuff through the WC narnia but there was a building not that far away from this place that I had to pay also some form of student contribution. While most German universities as I know do not charge tuition, it is a standard that a form of student contribution is payed that covers some administrative stuff and a basic student card to travel around by public transport. Now that I mention this, I might have actually done this much later, as my first month had to be covered by my own expense, just before the actual semester starts you may pay your administrative fees and receive the card that lets you travel with heavily limitations (like you can only travel in unlimited capacity before 7 and after 6 or something like this on weekdays and unlimited on weekends). These fees amounted to about 120 Euros. You could pay more at a ticket machine for a semesterticket, which I can't recall how much it was exactly but I think it amounted closer to an extra 200 Euros (which I did get, as it's bloody handy to have). In that meantime, as I was a very young fella, still just merely 20 years old (!) I was eligible for discounted tickets, which cost about 10 Euros for 10 stripes. As a person at 20 or below, I could stamp just one stripe per zone, for adults it's normally two stamps per zone. So, savings already. I'll explain the public transport on another time in greater lengths, it was a thing which continued to confuse me for a while.
</p>

<p>
  The more important thing which wasn't exactly the public transport was this EHIC thing I was marking off. See, the important thing about this was, that it wasn't just that I was marking this off. There was a very important part about all of this, as I had an entire list that I had to mark off and EHIC, as I believe, was the very last thing on this list which would allow me to get another, this time, paramountly important key thing. Before I go any further, a note of a vague clarification, I believe by the time I reached Germany, I in fact already have prolonged my exchange up to 2 semesters, as that was the max. Before, I had been doing a lot of research as the plan was to do another exchange somewhere else but as the German student calendar usually ended up a month after any semester anywhere else out in the world would start, I quickly found out that my foreseen dream of imbounding on an exchange to Canada was out of the question. The same went for, if I wanted at the time which wasn't exactly the case, US or maybe anywhere else, all of this was seemingly impossible due to my semester structure in Germany. It got me worried a bit and there were some forms of financial support that I was eligible for but it still kind of did not exactly calculate or if it did, I felt I'd turn out to 0 or close to this, maybe a bit on a minus maybe a plus and there were still a lot of very unflexible things to straighten out which could derail my finances. At one point during the exchange meeting in one of USYD's lecture rooms after it was confirmed where I'd be going, I asked the person in charge whether there are any scholarships or financial support available... in return, at my really genuinely great surprise I heard, that yes, in my case and the 2 other students going to LMU, there will be and a really good one. I don't think I received the details straight off but upon inquiring a bit further at the time, I was told that it could be like 500 Euros a month... Boom. I didn't want to make any assumptions or things for certain as this baloon could burst just anytime now and I was told that I'll get that confirmed. But in the end, it turned out even sweeter - 800 Euros a month + 1100 Euros of a travel grant. This was beyond anything I had imagined and had a hard time beliving that I missed this despite my massive research undertaking of where I should go on an exchange. This was a big reason why I decided to ask whether I could go on 2 semesters, as there seemed a slight chance that this scholarship would extend from 5 to 11 months and scale appropriately. And it did. Except to 10 months, which wasn't in any case a dealbreaker. This was a very well hidden scholarship, that I could in fact only dig out from LMU's website and it seemed only a select few of Australian and Thai universities had access to this. From what I know, many Erasmus students receive only 500 Euros a month for their exchange, which can barely cover accommodation in some cases. I on the other hand had a much larger backing up ultimately but that's for another story. Fastforward back to the EHIC thing, I in fact was still hangover and probably reeking a bit of alcohol. And at that very time, I wasn't just providing my European Health Insurance, which was a sort of a loophole, as typically Australian students and anyone outside of EU has to spend 50 Euros a month on this, I didn't as I had EHIC from Poland that I've got printed about 1-2 months prior to arriving and... at that point in time, I was leaving my signature with my details on the scholarship, as I was agreeing to receiving it upon fulfilling all the requirements.
</p>

<p>
  This made me feel very weird at the time. Not perhaps totally uncomfortable, it wasn't the first time that I had to somehow conceal the fact that I was drinking before meeting someone or getting something important done. Written this way it may even seem as if I was an alcoholic or something but none of this was the case, I just was sobering up and had some deadlines attached to when I could also get all this done. So I only left my details along with bank account stuff and my signature. And left the place, contemplating, how could that be, that I, Fuad, a person who didn't really have great grades in school and in German was probably worst of the worst, ended up at a top German and in fact European university with a massive scholarship that surpasses even most of what folks on this continent receive and Australia altogether. It was fairly unimaginable and in the state I was in, leaving my final signature, on a semi-drunken mind. I felt it was like some form of a grim commentary on the state of... I couldn't even tell. 9100 Euros. Half paid soon, 30% on the second semester and 20% at the end, provided that I successfully remain completing all the ECTS and I had great doubts in regards to whether I'll be able to pull all of this off. There were a lot of thoughts going through my head at the time. And in the end, I think I took a hike home. Perhaps it was another day after all that I was describing just now but in many details it did not fall behind much in regards to what I depicted.

    <center><h4>A few words more</h4></center>
    
<p>
  The other thing that I might have missed out on mentioning was my time spent at the Highrise as I came across someone from my university. Coming across Australians wasn't a rare thing around there. On the Highrise, I just said hello and exchanged a few words. I learned that this person would be staying just for a semester. I felt that was interesting as the money was quite big and reasonable enough to have the exchange longer. There were also some other Australians that I came across earlier. For example during the sightseeing time of Olydorf, these I think two people were from Western Sydney University, though. It was a brief exchange. Then much later on I found a big party with a lot of Australians on an Australia Day and it was a cool event. And I met a good Australian friend too. But all in all, it felt eerie that pretty much all the Australians that I've interacted with, they kind of just appeared and went out somewhere. Didn't keep in touch. Couldn't remain with for a longer period. In a way, same thing was happening in Australia as if many of those Australians just live in their own worlds and live in their own bubbles. And it didn't matter what their roots were, generation of Australians etc. Somehow, most of the time, things just didn't exactly click, it was mostly international folks and in that particular case, Germans who were the friendliest and most welcoming.
</p>

<p>
  Also, the time I was at the Bierstube after the sightseeing of Olydorf, I met a person from Thailand. And she was really enjoying this exchange, I think she said it was one of the greatest, best opportunities that she'd ever have. Very quickly have I realised that despite my success with securing this exchange, which all came into my hands a bit out of nowhere and just suddenly, this person sitting right across my table, most likely was coming from one of the same covered by a scholarship universities and receiving that massive bump of cash might have been an even larger opportunity than what I had locked in. It's not that Thailand is poor. But I've seen its capital and there are certainly lots living beyond below the poverty line. Well, it's funny how opportunities scatter to... could be random? Or perhaps actually the right people after all? I'm not sure I could really say at this stage.
</p>

<p>
  In principle, it's a funny thing. Within the spread of my entire life I notice moments, in which a major twist had happened, turning my life in a specifically turning, even perverse way. Reading Sapkowski, perhaps the only saga I ever read in life, after many years, yet at the end, I'm drawing lately a specific concept, whether fate in the end has some form of power. I have no idea, perhaps it exists in the end? Something pre-defines our existence? It feels so absurd, as if just bit too much. And yet, by some miracle, despite all my failures, unsuccessful approaches and in general foreseeing, and in the end of ends failures, I managed to turn all of it into something miraculous. True, I had some perks, which at first glimpse, were uncompromising yet in principle useless. Yet something appeared, that I ended up with where I ended up. And that was already Australia.
</p>

<p>
  Over there in the end I never experienced happiness. An Australian Dream. Beautiful concept just as its American counterpart, yet how different and again in some form similar. Passport isn't everything, afterwards as my story progressed, which was a carrousel of its own, which was able to wipe my brain, reset everything and put myself back to this neverending cycle, to which I neverendingly return and which I utmostly hate. Something kept me going, though. I had some form of a draft of a plan, which I could potentially execute, although it was in a very delicate form before my departure. And I departed already with an empty head as a nobody. A human from nowhere, without any exceptional achievements, without anything in fact. I didn't expect that I would return to Europe so fast, I didn't expect, that whatever would stand on my path, that is worth pursuing; perhaps vegetating wouldn't be so bad after all? Meanwhile the path I've chosen, was rich in such bumps, that at times a person can... in my case, to some degree, you could just no longer.
</p>

<p>
  An entire year I've squandered on a meaningless little things. It could've turned out completely differently. I regret lots, yet on the other hand I can't complain on how I turned out. I ended up in such a place, in which I in fact have wanted, although I still didn't feel satisfied, even then! I created a new plan. I analysed and studied my own capabilities. An exchange was always at my crosshairs, taking under consideration, that it was able to set me for the future in an unprecedented at anytime way. Even with the environment I was living in in Australia, an exchange was able to provide me a year of entire freedom, a concept I placed at the highest possible point of my values and by which I was lead by while I was leaving to a dream, and then again overseas. Meanwhile then, even an exchange turned up with and into unexpected events.

    <center><h4>eh?</h4></center>

    <p>
      Have I mentioned Munich already? Yet I wanted to Montreal! Why? I don't know! Sehnsucht. This feeling of endless longing of something that of which you cannot satisfy. That's how my new series will be called, as I guess that's how it already works with me. A person receives something, yet the person still doesn't feel enough. Life teaches us lots of things... yet, I digress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why Montreal? I have no idea. I thought, that Australia is the same form of a wildcard as is Canada. Perhaps I could learn French? It ended up on Munich. The second choice, that's where they placed me. My German, as it was, all my friends from high school I think were aware of what level it was on. I received more or less 2 months to grind through to B1 level. I managed to only pass well 2 out of 4. It was enough. I thought, that the 3rd semester I may fuck up due to databases. As major of a challenge it was, with exams and a teacher, who spoke in English just as well as I did in German. Plus a double-credited UX course, in which I got placed in a group, where me with my friend alone have managed to work out the majority of what was expected (hours of monotoneous work), which not always profited or were equal to the massive undertaking performed. I had some many doubts. A sea of conclusions leading everywhere, which contradicted each other. Even, as pessimistic I was while approaching discussions with a visiting student or my course coordinator, who I think shared my views, at the time I thought already, that I have managed to accomplish the impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      I thought, that I have already reached the impossible with Australia already. Meanwhile, things started to unfold just about now. Yet I don't want to touch this topic yet. Not sure even why. I don't see anything special of all. Lots of luck. A shitload of luck. Yet and while by arduously pushing forward. By quite dampened mental state, with all the aspects of my start, in principle on my own, despite that I had an unsecured support of my homecountry to kickstart my new journey. I'm not entirely sure how it happened, yet everything kept falling into place as expected up to a 95% up to somepoint. With larger bumps encountered here and there, yet I got by. Notwithstanding, with success responsibility goes hand in hand. 
    </p>

        <p>
      Meanwhile, the conditions on which I was sent to Munich, were fairytale-like. With each step I took, fear came along. Meanwhile, I always had some aces up my sleeve. They placed me in the Olympic Village. I was secured financially. In addition, I was let to study a course similar to what I was doing in Australia, yet at a more specialised level. In time, something even more unbelieveable had happened. They treat me as a Master's student. This is cosmic-like, at the age of 20 I am doing coursework made for people who are at a Master's level, I have no idea how it will all turn out, yet I already got a sense of what to expect and just that. The actual journey is right ahead of me.

      Meanwhile, I'm left with just one question. This one, only question, for which I expect to receive an answer. As there is a limit, in which case, how much one may achieve and what could be achieved in life. Some things stop weighing as important. A person begins to look into mechanisms by which life is lead by, especially your own life is lead by. Then I start binding analogies between analogies, in case of life of other people and my own. Based on everyday life and educated based on artistic visions. In general the question in my case is based on one thing. How far can I go? What else is within my reach? I managed to receive so much and meanwhile it seems, as if it was just the beginning... yet, the problem is this broken circle. The environment here really positively reinforces me, yet for long-term accommodation to life, such subliminally learned reaction to life and impulses coming to a person... There is no way to counter with just merely a two weeks long leisure. A person will comeback to the old routines, style of life, which doesn't fit. If I want changes, these must be executed long-term. I know well that without success, I won't be able to go further.

      A snowball effect, as they say. I am meanwhile a locomotive. I feel like one. It's hard to make the first step, yet once I take on velocity... Meanwhile I'd like to be like a universal locomotive. Such, that can suddenly change its appearance, form, mass and ascend, alight and dive. Such, that can adapt to its environment. To not say, one may say anything on and about me. And in any and either case, you will be right.

    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      A few words about sports. Upon entering Male I was actually quite amazed with how narrow streets there were. And how cheap it kinda was. And then I saw also some people playing some weird game I have not seen by flicking pieces on a board. Now I am at the airport. And they were some thing popping up. A rock concert running for quite a bit by an Asian rock band. Then some Criquette. And then, holy shit, Premiere League and whoever's left at the airport. Hindi, Mali, flight attendants, police officers, they're watching. To speak of an experience binding cultures and generations. Amazing.</p>

<p>I mean, Male is not a special place. In fact, this is a country that you'll go to, only and solely for the purpose of going for a holiday but only to a resort. A private resort. One you'll need a speedboat or a water plane to get to. The hotel I was in, which was an inn actually, wasn't that bad. I had some problems with finding a good place and eventually I booked this last-minute which was a good decision, although a bit stressful one. Basically I put forward a bit more money but I received the bang for the buck - taxi all the way to the place and from the hotel to the airport at the place's cost. I got breakfast, which was a set of take what you need: fried eggs, sausages, broccoli, some pastries, fruits etc. I got a refill and some coffee. Also you had a coffee machine in the place and tea and bottles of water, all complimentary. All this, for a bit like 70U$. I felt like it was a good decision in the end. Although I feel I should have booked something else, also had wifi and the luggage carried which was unexpected. Got wifi. And the other complimentary stuff, I mean it was literally a 4-star hotel. Perhaps 3 but on the verge of being a 4. And I got my sleep. 7.5 hours. That's a lifesaver, trust me folks on this one.</p>

<p>One of the last problems that I am standing in front of, is my condition. Usually when I assemble my travel puzzle pieces I don't really take under consideration the fact that me, as any other person, can fall ill. I mean, obviously there are the hazard of eating in Delhi or getting some forms of malaria etc. But what I usually don't really take seriously is my condition to just fall ill and it all starts from dust. I started feeling a bit off while in Poland and then for serious in Helsinki, although it got better. Eventually, perhaps the large rollercoaster of AC and humid heat decided to stir shit in my body and in the end, at the airport, I am basically inept a bit. As in, sneezing, yellow phlegm. Kinda standard and the funniest part - it always gets to me at least once or twice a year. It's great that I decided to cut short my trip, hehe, as shorter it gets I mean, by having a shorter transfer in Kuala Lumpur. This way I will be able to get home faster but at the same time, there are hazard associated - cold aircraft's AC, the need for food and water. Basically I won't end up seeing anything in KUL but perhaps I'll be able to go to sleep faster. That's what I'm counting on. It's good that they had showers at Male's airport, this way I was able to get off all this sweat that I've accumulated in hectolitres while stumbling through Male. That probably also contributed negatively. Oh well.</p>

<p>Being deprived of sleep creates very interesting cognitive patterns. At times you'd feel as if you've seen something, like a mild form of -nesia kicks in. Also, listening to music makes you realize, that it is kind of deprived a bit of bass. Tonal environment and reception is especially interesting.</p>

<p>And UFC is running.<br>
