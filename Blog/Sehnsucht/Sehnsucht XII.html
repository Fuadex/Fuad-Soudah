    <p>
      What, you think I'd continue going in positives?
    </p>

    <p>
    Have you read anything from Sehnsucht by now?
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, if you haven't but for some reason you're reading this particular entry out of all, then you must know there is an entire dimension of stuff that I didn't learn and wish I have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which I think I should be very blunt about and speak my mind very freely.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is an entire balancing act that humans perform throughout their lives and this is the simple act of living that is in its core.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the essence of problem I had was something that resonates to this very day and which I always felt, ever since I acquired this exchange opportunity.

  <center><h4>The Song of Eternity</h4></center>
    <br>

    <p>
      There were many times when things got particularly bad for me. Things that didn't have to be bad. That were all conceived from the very within of me that were all based on wrong presumptions and ways I perceived life to be. And the very essence of it all was that I didn't really know how life is in the beautiful and magnificent array it is. And that reflected on how I interacted with people and me not knowing how to interact with them really based on everything I have known. And there was really nothing and no one that could really teach any of this to me because... I just simply didn't know.
    </p>

    <p>
      On one hand it was the opportunity I was dealt that was much too good to be true and as it unravelled as it did, with so much money being directed to me, more than I have ever seen in my life and definitely more than I could potentially spend honestly. All this felt, somehow, just that I didn't deserve any of it. It's like as if I won the lottery and just kept asking myself: why me. How come I get to reap such a reward for exactly... what. What were my achievements. What have I done proper in my life to get to this. Why am I getting this. How should I procede forward is unclear. How should I deal with all this is unclear. Sharing with anyone that burden as I felt seamed just not fair. How do you tell anyone that in a year you'll probably get what I think topped at 50k $ for just simply the act of studying. And how do you tell them that you feel bad about this. How would the others respond? They're also students. They're making probably much less. Some have to work to support themselves. Some make ends meet with what their Erasmus Scholarship provides, for some its not enough to enough fill their rent. Some are on financial support from the government. None of this felt right and there were also some issues that I had to get all of it but once it kept turning into a positive scenario, I just kept feeling even worse about all this. I didn't really prepare any plan or anything to manage any of it all.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a pretty good backbone of what I was dealing with, presented with an entire world of possibilities, feared of what if, I mean what if I fuck something up and I have to return some of this money, what if something else happens, what if someone steals something, what if whatever. I mean once I got my bicycle stolen I felt absolutely bad. There was a beautiful silver lining to this but I also felt there was a dire lack of support, I just didn't really know exactly how to keep it all in form and handle the knowledge of all this and keep going forward. It was a mind-boggling frenzy and feeling in fact of as if something particularly bad has happened because I just simply thought I had not deserved any of this, knowing lots of other people out there. And I felt once in a lifetime opportunity like this and I've got a beautiful path of seeing all this wasted, probably despite all my best efforts, which, in the end, sort of became a form of waste. I'm not talking about squandering all the money I received. But just looking back all these years, I hardly remember as much that actually fuels who I am now and what really is of value and what realls just remains, with a few exceptions that are still sort of dissipating in the background, as unfortunate as I feel it all just is.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess what I'm saying is just how fleeting life is.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I associated a great deal with this exchange, I put a tremendous amount of effort to get somewhere and prove myself to be of worth and value and match what I received so I could keep going forward and prove myself to really be of value. And this sort of in years just turned into nothing. And looking back I'm just thinking what could have gone wrong, because not necessarily that much did. I kind of foresaw lots of it. But I still feel bad I couldn't double down on this.

    <center><h4>The Other Dimension</h4></center>

    <p>
      Then there was the way to deal with people. Sadly, all the problems of me not knowing so many thing came haunting me throughout this exchange, despite not being all that all-round bad, still could've been all awash, if only. For instance, my language capabilities. Sure there are lots of exchange students who aren't as competent in English as even I was at the time. But damn it, I'm an exchange student from Australia, I should be. And being in Germany I should have already some decent German skills but I hadn't. And that seriously limited my interaction with other people, as I just felt that, well, even if I talk, what do I talk about, to flow around in conversations between one another. I guess it was the shyness. I guess it was the shame. And I still managed to overcome this to a certain extent. But damn it, it could've been so much better.
</p>

<p>
    And there's the other dimension of me just being a young person. A student, at a respected, in fact, universities and being open-minded and out and about and doing stuff, discovering things, filling your life with everything. Instead, I found my life to be a hole with often not that much to do and wondering what to do and being left to lots of different and not as positive thoughts. And really not even making use of many things that were so close. I mean, I had a swimming pool a few minutes away from my bungalow but I didn't use it, because I barely swam in my life. I barely did any fitness because I don't know how to do it properly. I barely cooked much because I barely know how to cook anything. There's no instrument I can play. There're no sports for me to play if I don't have people to play with and if I'm as shy as I was back then, I wouldn't want to participate anyway. And I still was a bit overweight at the time. Fairly freshly that year I got down 15 kilos, so I was obese at the beginning of that year too. In any case, so many thing out of the books and me just not doing and not committing.
</p>

<p>
  And then's the human aspect. Even if I got acquainted a bit I didn't really commit 100% and didn't take everything I was told seriously, despite I should've. If I did, I would probably even have a part-time job. An in fact I should've looked for one more seriously, because having the experience of a job overseas would've had a lifechanging impact on me. And I decided instead to focus 100% on my studies. Big amiss. And there are so many other things that just didn't work out due to my ineptness to approach them. I realise I'm not the only one but damn how bad it made me feel and how bad it made me feel feeling recurrently about feeling all this. Big broken circle of feelings that I couldn't really remedy for and which I felt were a big blocker for my growth. Another thing that I just felt was a big waste and that I felt could've been prevented if my growing up went differently.

    <center><h4>And then the human aspect, again</h4></center>
    
    <p>
      Not knowing much, not understanding people, not interacting enough and not forming any deeper or even fleeting forms of interaction with others. Because this is the time of life when you should be out and about, meeting people, talking, playing, doing a myriad of things that young people do and me holding back and not really exactly doing all this and not pursuing different things. Learning things. Primarily of all this, just being around people and learning from them and them. Being with them and around them but I guess also having something in return and being able to return something that they'd find of value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being more open-minded, being more altruistic and stepping out with suggestions, being more straightforward and seeking out everything, pursuing my interests and what interests at specific moments, not holding back. Making seriously the most of what the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this was, so that I don't end up feeling like any of this was a waste because it wasn't but there were too many things I just should've dropped as were not worth pursuing. Instead, there were too many nights spent at a half-furnished place that kind of reflected the half-furnished person I was, with much of what I felt, quite in fact true but not that much room that I felt could've had expanded to make it more liveable.
    </p>

    <p>
      And even as I left this journey quite satisfied with what I managed to accomplish, things turned very fast and in the end I felt at the other end again, an outcast that doesn't have that much to offer again and who can't make much of life as life is because I can't understand so many things because of how just broken so many things in all due process and before were and turned out to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's kind of sad to think about all this in such bleak spectrums but the truth is that lots of this exchange was covered in great deal of shade. Not that anything wasn't done by the books. It's just my life wasn't a great book and it could've been a great deal more, if only.

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      A few words about sports. Upon entering Male I was actually quite amazed with how narrow streets there were. And how cheap it kinda was. And then I saw also some people playing some weird game I have not seen by flicking pieces on a board. Now I am at the airport. And they were some thing popping up. A rock concert running for quite a bit by an Asian rock band. Then some Criquette. And then, holy shit, Premiere League and whoever's left at the airport. Hindi, Mali, flight attendants, police officers, they're watching. To speak of an experience binding cultures and generations. Amazing.</p>

<p>I mean, Male is not a special place. In fact, this is a country that you'll go to, only and solely for the purpose of going for a holiday but only to a resort. A private resort. One you'll need a speedboat or a water plane to get to. The hotel I was in, which was an inn actually, wasn't that bad. I had some problems with finding a good place and eventually I booked this last-minute which was a good decision, although a bit stressful one. Basically I put forward a bit more money but I received the bang for the buck - taxi all the way to the place and from the hotel to the airport at the place's cost. I got breakfast, which was a set of take what you need: fried eggs, sausages, broccoli, some pastries, fruits etc. I got a refill and some coffee. Also you had a coffee machine in the place and tea and bottles of water, all complimentary. All this, for a bit like 70U$. I felt like it was a good decision in the end. Although I feel I should have booked something else, also had wifi and the luggage carried which was unexpected. Got wifi. And the other complimentary stuff, I mean it was literally a 4-star hotel. Perhaps 3 but on the verge of being a 4. And I got my sleep. 7.5 hours. That's a lifesaver, trust me folks on this one.</p>

<p>One of the last problems that I am standing in front of, is my condition. Usually when I assemble my travel puzzle pieces I don't really take under consideration the fact that me, as any other person, can fall ill. I mean, obviously there are the hazard of eating in Delhi or getting some forms of malaria etc. But what I usually don't really take seriously is my condition to just fall ill and it all starts from dust. I started feeling a bit off while in Poland and then for serious in Helsinki, although it got better. Eventually, perhaps the large rollercoaster of AC and humid heat decided to stir shit in my body and in the end, at the airport, I am basically inept a bit. As in, sneezing, yellow phlegm. Kinda standard and the funniest part - it always gets to me at least once or twice a year. It's great that I decided to cut short my trip, hehe, as shorter it gets I mean, by having a shorter transfer in Kuala Lumpur. This way I will be able to get home faster but at the same time, there are hazard associated - cold aircraft's AC, the need for food and water. Basically I won't end up seeing anything in KUL but perhaps I'll be able to go to sleep faster. That's what I'm counting on. It's good that they had showers at Male's airport, this way I was able to get off all this sweat that I've accumulated in hectolitres while stumbling through Male. That probably also contributed negatively. Oh well.</p>

<p>Being deprived of sleep creates very interesting cognitive patterns. At times you'd feel as if you've seen something, like a mild form of -nesia kicks in. Also, listening to music makes you realize, that it is kind of deprived a bit of bass. Tonal environment and reception is especially interesting.</p>
