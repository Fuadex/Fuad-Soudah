    <center><h4>Of Living</h4></center>

    <p>
      Another thing I sort of learned in the process, which I think requires a bit of broaching is the simple concept of living.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yeeees, I know, this is a massive concept and I could potentially write anything about it! And anyone can write anything and there will be so many variation that it will go on to infinity and beyond. But seriously, some stuff requires your own perspective and how things shifted your own. And there is a good deal to talk about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what is it that I should go back to and really emphasise on?
    </p>

    <p>
      I think I've got an angle or even a few that I should double down on.
    </p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Looks</h4></center>

    <p>
      You know, let's be honest, I never really was a beautiful fella. Perhaps when I was seriously young, say, pre-15, I had some potential. But anytime afterwards it was laissez faire growth in an in the end not quite debauched way, so kinda controlled but a bit out of it and not necessarily in ways that would normally make sense, just there, hanging and it kept growing. And from all this different things grow too.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance my sense of fashion. I'd care to say, I had an absolute none as a teenager, whatever clothes I was provided by my family, I would wear and I think back then I kind of hated it but what was the alternative? Did any of my family members know where to buy clothes or know what looks good on me? In the end lots of stuff I would get bought would totally not work together, would be too large and to be honest my sense of what looked good wasn't any good either. Think on this for a moment when I tell you and what you might already know, that I was studying a combination of design and computing, even if in Germany it was HCI/Mediainformatics, man, some standards should still apply. But damn it, I was starting from the bare start in the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually when I moved to Australia and found myself a bit of capital to spend I'd spend it on T-shirts with funny or nice logos closely associated to the TV Shows I'd watch. So like, Hurley saying DUDE in aberrated colors or Breaking Bad logo being in GTA format or crossovers between shows etc. And baggy trousers, pair of white addidas shoes I'd even wear in combation with a suit. Some stuff I look back on, like the suit addidas combo as cute, for some quite off-putting sure but still quite cute, funny and interesting as I find it up till this day. In terms of the logos on shirts... eh.. maybe at this age it was cool but was there any style to this? Is this seriously a great thing to go out and flash a Breaking Banana logo out and about? For what, to strike a conversation? Please. I guess some people still wear Brooklyn shirts and even Berkeley shirts despite never being or studying at either. But what do I know? I mean, writing all this today, I am pretty much after a semester of strictly fashion school so I should know something eh?
    </p>

    <p>
      But back then it was still that situation and it really started to change once my mom for a change actually bought something I found quite particularly interesting. I believe it was a set of tshirts, that I almost automatically refused to wear as usual but something felt different about these tshirts and they were really different to whatever I have worn before. And they were. They felt nice, even despite being just cotton-woven. And then one being distinctly light and nice to wear, this was linen. And these shirts were plain, looked good on me, some colors were nicer, some less but in the end I was like, plain and simple, feels good wearing them and... well, I don't think I have ever worn something as nice before.

    <center><h4>And you know</h4></center>

    <p>
      I didn't even have anything seriously nice, such as, let's say, cashmere, it was just a cotton shirt but as I discovered, a cotton shirt does not equal a different cotton shirt. Somehow, someone, gave notion to my mom of COS and she got a couple of things for me and I seriously like it. COS being a better version of H&M, the same company, just making products bit better and from better materials. Eventually I'd be bought a sweater, woolen but looked amazing and felt nice. Again, simple, rather minimal designs but still I felt looked great and felt great. A couple of times I'd turn up in Warsaw my mom would take me out to one of those stores to take a look at what's on. And sometimes it'd be nice to just touch the clothes. I think one time I'd get a cashmere sweater. Some other time a pair of well simple but feeling quite heavy and yet quite sturdy pair of pants. A scarf, a hat. A decent coat bought somewhere else. But the difference in terms of feel and how fast the clothes would just simply rip was paramount. I'm a big fella and moving so much, I would just find lots of clothes being wasted even after 2 months of use. And true I don't have an entire wardrobe of stuff, I'd usually have up to 2 pairs of shoes, maybe a few trousers and twice as many t-shirts etc. But just buying a pair of trousers that rip after 2 months is a disgrace. The stuff from COS, I could at times use for longer than a year and even beyond that, especially if cared properly after. I've still got a sweater that I got bought at that time, it doesn't look as great but I can still wear it and feels good wearing it. In case of t-shirts, the lifespan would be usually about over a year but I'd even continue wearing them once holes started forming in them.
</p>

<p>
  All these of course cost money, more than for clothes bought at more traditional stores or at some knock-off markets. But I discovered the feeling of quality and the pleasure of just going out shopping and trying to find something that looks good on you and feels good wearing it. Sometimes they'd have specials like 30% off, 50% off and I'd feel extra good for buying good stuff for a fraction of whatever I was spending. But in the end it also just feels good looking good and feeling good by knowing that you just look like a human being even if it was just one part of living. I mean, I still didn't visit a barber but that's for another time. Another thing was also, a pair of shoes. In my case, hiking shoes which also came at a price but damn the amount of kilometers I'd walk in them. With a record of 50 I've done in Paris in a single day. My feet would be massacred but no way I'd be came to do as much with a regular pair of shoes. Having a pair with which I could go anywhere and that would not get wreaked in merely half a year was also an interesting pleasure. A lesser one compared to going out and buying decent clothes. To which I should come back for a sec, as these clothes and the onces I'd choose would usually be quite simple, one colour, preferably dark but some of them bright, sometimes with an interesting combination of colours but nothing eye-boggling, the target was having it all functional and minimal. It all kind of worked. And in terms of shoes, there was a bit of juggling between companies but a pair of hiking shoes and a more laidback pair was a decent combination. Except the more laidback pair would get wreaked in a year, whereas the hiking shoes, it took me 3 years to barely murder them. In the end, I felt it was a great discovery for me, just the pleasure of shopping, seeing value in it and discovering that there are better things in more usual things, like clothes of instance, something that I didn't quite pay attention to but I know many are out there crazy about them.
</p>

<p>
  And I began seeing why.

    <p>
      Extended to other things as well. Eventually I got myself a pair of custom IEMs, which cost a notch but holy shit once I received them, I just felt like in some sort of heaven. At least the way the rub my senses and just music can be even more beautiful than this. This is a completely seperate journey to talk about but suddenly during this exchange I had the opportunity and viability to afford an entry-level pair that I used again for about 4 years afterwards. A great change compared to most of the IEMs I'd get wreaked in just a matter of half a year or even less than this.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'd discover the pleasure of going to IKEA to just buy a couple of essential things like a frying pan, linen etc. Weird thing to talk about but once you get a place of your own you want thing to arrange your life with. And suddenly cook. And find places to buy groceries from. Not just the supermarket but also the greengrocer and finding they have a better offering and fresher produce! And learning there are specific produce for instance my mom was looking for, for instance pumpkin seed oil, that was supposedly only available in Germany. And then once I got to Poland, I'd discover there was an entire boom in the craft beer sector and discovering all the amazing array of craft beers tasting so good. And other things like freshly squeezed juices from fruits that I've never known to have existed. And try phenomenal arrays of cheeses and even vinegar, not knowing before visiting one place Eataly in Munich, that a such simple thing that is usually repulsive as vinegar, can taste in fact so good.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess what I'm trying to get at is that somehow, somewhat, this exchange brought me closer to appreciating quality and finding out that there are quality products and that there is value in the acquisition of some things that I might have thought as trivial beforehand. For instance, I'd prefer to buy thing from the internet when I was a teenager "because it was cheaper" rather than locally. Which, to be fair, in certain cases makes sense once you understand the chain of how products move around. At times you'll go to the local market and buy produce that are exactly the same yet even more expensive of whatever compared to the supermarket. But you start seeing things differently with time and as you explore more things and as you see how others interact with the world. For instance when my mom travelled, she'd prefer to immerse herself to the place she'd travel to in very interesting ways. Just spend time around, going to a morning market to get local produce and cook something from the ingredients she'd buy. Sometimes something traditional. Sometimes something new that she just thought of. This is another level that I'm far from. But it opens your eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, it's not just you moving but as you move you somehow react to other people and people react to you and how you move what you know what you've seen, all this interferes with one another, resonates and somehow I suppose the world can keep getting better if it remains like this and there are positive vibes to be shared all around.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end it's not just me that learned but I certainly learned from others many things and discovered and entire floor of things and the spectrum of how things are and can be and what's beyond the horizon that I myself have subconsciously established.
    </p>

    <p>
      These were the good things.

    <center><h4>Phase Two</h4></center>
    
    Now once I had my belly full, I could start making my way to the art village. Technically, Gamcheon Culture Village, which is actually a heritage site. At least it feels like one, it might not be one, though. To do that, I had to take yet another bus and upon reaching the, well, start of the area, I was presented with a choice, that was really rather presented just in my own eyes. For some reason, I also wanted to see the city and there was, technically, a path leading towards a park. On the other hand I could dedicate myself to roaming the village. Out of the two, I went with the park, despite I had some bad experiences with parks and peaks in this country, as they usually lead towads... well, no particular views whatsoever. I took the risk, after all, what risk was that? And so it took a while, like usual, a bit of walking along a foresty area. But I was quite quickly rewarded with glimpses and then halfly, unconstrained view of Busan. The temperature and humidity quickly reminded myself via excessing sweating that, it is going to be a hell of a walk and that perhaps I should plan this a bit better. But I continued and upon venturing into a few side tracks... I discovered... not quite what I wanted. But it was still surprising to find out, that in literally, nowhere, the rabbit holes lead me to.. here, for instance: a volleyball pitch, public gym and something that I have not ever seen before. I mean, have you ever seen weightlifting equipment, as in weight/barbells in its all natural form? I mean, as those used as actual rocks. And natural benches to lift those up? And that all of this, remained where it was and was quite eagerly attended always by at least a few people?<br><br>

    Now this view actually repeated itself a few times upon me detouring into the unknown paths. One of the main attractions was however, a open sculpture park. Some of the sculptures, really really good. Koreans can honestly do those to a very nicely perfected level, detailed, surreal at times and powerfully striking if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised by how they managed to populate this park. But I still did not get to see anything from it, despite that it was undoubtedly a hill. I decided to venture off to yet another path. That lead towards yet another... public gym. But I didn't rest at that point, I thought, hell, there must be something. And so I kept on going, went into somewhat a trippy area with grass growing higher than myself on each side, then a few more steps, yet another detour and I arrived at a destination, with a clear, almost entirely unobstructed view on two contrasting sides of Busan. A treat, that I was after for the past, well, almost an hour now. And considering my feet and the altitude I climbed, I also had to rest now.<br><br>

      A few words about sports. Upon entering Male I was actually quite amazed with how narrow streets there were. And how cheap it kinda was. And then I saw also some people playing some weird game I have not seen by flicking pieces on a board. Now I am at the airport. And they were some thing popping up. A rock concert running for quite a bit by an Asian rock band. Then some Criquette. And then, holy shit, Premiere League and whoever's left at the airport. Hindi, Mali, flight attendants, police officers, they're watching. To speak of an experience binding cultures and generations. Amazing.</p>

<p>I mean, Male is not a special place. In fact, this is a country that you'll go to, only and solely for the purpose of going for a holiday but only to a resort. A private resort. One you'll need a speedboat or a water plane to get to. The hotel I was in, which was an inn actually, wasn't that bad. I had some problems with finding a good place and eventually I booked this last-minute which was a good decision, although a bit stressful one. Basically I put forward a bit more money but I received the bang for the buck - taxi all the way to the place and from the hotel to the airport at the place's cost. I got breakfast, which was a set of take what you need: fried eggs, sausages, broccoli, some pastries, fruits etc. I got a refill and some coffee. Also you had a coffee machine in the place and tea and bottles of water, all complimentary. All this, for a bit like 70U$. I felt like it was a good decision in the end. Although I feel I should have booked something else, also had wifi and the luggage carried which was unexpected. Got wifi. And the other complimentary stuff, I mean it was literally a 4-star hotel. Perhaps 3 but on the verge of being a 4. And I got my sleep. 7.5 hours. That's a lifesaver, trust me folks on this one.</p>

<p>One of the last problems that I am standing in front of, is my condition. Usually when I assemble my travel puzzle pieces I don't really take under consideration the fact that me, as any other person, can fall ill. I mean, obviously there are the hazard of eating in Delhi or getting some forms of malaria etc. But what I usually don't really take seriously is my condition to just fall ill and it all starts from dust. I started feeling a bit off while in Poland and then for serious in Helsinki, although it got better. Eventually, perhaps the large rollercoaster of AC and humid heat decided to stir shit in my body and in the end, at the airport, I am basically inept a bit. As in, sneezing, yellow phlegm. Kinda standard and the funniest part - it always gets to me at least once or twice a year. It's great that I decided to cut short my trip, hehe, as shorter it gets I mean, by having a shorter transfer in Kuala Lumpur. This way I will be able to get home faster but at the same time, there are hazard associated - cold aircraft's AC, the need for food and water. Basically I won't end up seeing anything in KUL but perhaps I'll be able to go to sleep faster. That's what I'm counting on. It's good that they had showers at Male's airport, this way I was able to get off all this sweat that I've accumulated in hectolitres while stumbling through Male. That probably also contributed negatively. Oh well.</p>

<p>Being deprived of sleep creates very interesting cognitive patterns. At times you'd feel as if you've seen something, like a mild form of -nesia kicks in. Also, listening to music makes you realize, that it is kind of deprived a bit of bass. Tonal environment and reception is especially interesting.</p>

<p>And UFC is running.<br>
