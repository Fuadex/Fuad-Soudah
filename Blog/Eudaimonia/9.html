    Do you know this feeling, when you're sitting, in front of a tool. On one hand inert, the tool won't budge unless you do. On the other you are more than willing to budge but instead, you won't. With the state preserving for the continuity of a relative period and beyond, the term of which remains ambivalent and just as the predecesor, relative.<br><br>

    You don't? Well then, you're a happy bloke. Congratulations! You seem to have a achieved something fundamental in life. You do? Well then, it's a tough church to overcome this tight screw, ain't it? To think of it, there isn't much required or attached or anything, it's all pure imagination, the devil building all these fortresses of constraint. I'm quite good with coming up with entirely new ones. Popping the ones before with a simple touch, it's ridiculous how much you may achieve with as much but mine was of pure imagination. One that likes to revisit the old constructs.<br><br>

  </div><br>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Of... what exactly?</h4></center>
    I've been wondering for quite some time in regards as to whether I should actually start doing something. Take a look at the previous sentence. And once again? You see what I did there? I'm at a state in which I could go on forever with such, it's as if revisiting square one all over again. But the issue is yet more fundamental. Just, it's a different kind of fundamental. It's a fundament of inert and imagination. One that prompts me to revisit all the fortresses but more in relation to what prompted their construct. It's more of a way of combating my current state, as I know many other students get into the same flawed flow. All is there and in place but yet somehow the cogs just do not turn, all of a sudden. And I know why they are not turning. Except, that I also know what prompted the reason for why they are not turning. What exactly were the origins of it and only partially why I kind of succumbed to this inertness. At this point, I feel that this is an illness. And looking back I just wish that someone did something about that.<br><br>

    So instead of telling how fragile I've become all of a sudden and I will just move on and tell you how fragile I have become all of a sudden. Which is the epithome of what has become all of a sudden. It is very disturbing to see myself not being able to communicate with others using the same language. The very same thing happening with all the languages that I do know. It is very disturbing to see that many with whom I interact fail to respond positively to how I initiate interaction. This might be more of an illness symptom but does feel that something is off and I don't know exactly the reason why. Despite, that I feel like I am generally a very social fella and don't wish for anybody to feel bad or anything. Might it be that I can't use words properly? Or I just begin to forget how they synthesize? This just may be an illness symptom.<br><br>

    It all pains me to see because I know how productive I may become. I know how valuable I can be and how much good I can generate. All of which were qualities that I kept putting into question after years of a mixture consiting of work, neglect, anxiety and ambition. But what I managed to achieve throughout the years speak for itself. Even the works I felt stood negatively out, were not all that bad in the end. It was just the process that I kept fucking up and it pains me to think, that nobody and I mean nobody throughout all these years has really explained to me what is actually important. What I should be aiming for. What are the milestones that I should achieve. How I should prepare. In the end, after all these years I deducted, that University of Sydney, for all its glory, it provides opportunities. Many of which I have in scrutiny explored and maximised... but not quite.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Not quite.</h4></center>

	Before I get into the not quite part. I still feel that my accomplishments, alongside of what should have been clarified in regards to what required, all were along the way disregarded. Partially the blame is on my end, as I have not provided much details in regards to how much of an accomplishment it was. I just don't feel like to brag and boast. And there was quite a substantial reason to do that. One that really kicked in and showcased that here is this guy, who never really performed really well at school for some reason gets admitted to University of Sydney. Sure, there are better Universities in Australia. Melbourne, National, UNSW very competitive. Some probably thought that it was nothing. Although, I'm probably wrong. I think it was quite recognised at the time. In the end. And it did feel great. Until I had to request psychological help, which came oh how conveniently, after a month of waiting for help.<br><br>

	Let's pursue that further, shall we? The moment I was admitted to University of Sydney, was when I was cashing out weekly an equivalent of 400$ on accommodation weekly. That was a time when I had to desperately seek out help, which I received, after I got into a row with my father over a pack of Lindt chocolates and had to live his household. I'm not exaggerating, this is something I will never forget, to get treated like this and have ultimatums set. If there is one value that I put at the forefront of everything there is in my life, that would be freedom. And that was consistently violated both when I was in Poland and when I was in Australia. Unknowing what comes next, I decided on a dire adventure. One that put me into a very hazardous position. It didn't end badly, in fact, there were many positives that came out of this. But there could have been so much more if only my parents did their job properly.<br><br>

	And what did I have back in Poland? Restrictions, more restrictions. Being treated like a perfect child, overly looked after. Being forced religion onto. Being fed too well. Being put into a corner of withdrawal to video games. From the perspective of a 22 years old, I'm beginning to question why I did how I did back then. It was clearly not working towards my wellbeing or personal growth. It made me a nobody and kept me at bay of not being able to achieve anything in life. Except, that I did see value in what I played. And I did see value in the tv shows I've watched. And I still managed to be with people to a limited amount of time I had. I... don't remember how I've been. I would have to look into the tons of photos and videos I have backed up from these years. It wasn't bad... But it wasn't also something I was looking towards achieving. My expectations greatly derailed with what I managed to scramble up. Turned out, the scramble was the optimum I could really get in my situation. But I never came to anywhere close where I aimed for...<br><br>

	But even if I did. I would have probably never ended up here. But if I did, I would not be necessarily in a better situation. And I would have never really became better prepared in the end.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Misalignment</h4></center>

	It is sad to say this but my interests were never met. While my cousin would get utensils to get better at drawing I would get books to learn maths and physics. From perspective, I don't think I was bad at this just because I was bad at this. I never really had the motivation to study maths or to do maths well and consistently. I never was in an environment in which I would even want to learn maths of physics. In the end I don't think I was being taught this quite well. Even at Polish I sucked. And I sucked at English. And probably most of the other subjects altogether. Something was wrong throughout all these years and before but somehow I managed to top points at English. And through a ridiculous system, I managed to turn up with a surprisingly decent ATAR of 82. That put me in this 'there is this course which has this really cool website' course. Which probably turned out to be yet another giggle elicited by the bi-polar luck I have tangled up with. I submited a portfolio, which could have boosted my chance of admission. I think I received no points at all. Why would I? I mean it's not like my parents really gave me any means to be good at design-related subjects, all in all? Well, if not fine arts then maybe programming? I actually got myself some books related to this. But with limited comprehension skills and nobody to teach me how to execute any code, all I could do is an html webpage. It's just sad. There is much more I work that I see that has not been done in regards to me. There is so little really for parents to do in regards to their only child. Do you know, that my first time at an optometrist was here in Australia? Just a few weeks ago. I was told I have long-sightedness and astigmatism. How the fuck it is possible that's the first time I'm hearing of this?<br><br>

	And, with no skills whatsoever, I got admitted to a fantastic course at a fantastic university. All fantastic on its shell. I grew meticulously critical of many courses throughout the degrees. In the end, it doesn't break down too bad compared to my alternatives... But getting into the university was the only positive thing that happened to me at that particular time in life. I just wish I really received support at this stage. Some sort of meaningful one, not just cash but like a job to have a clear perspective and blend myself into the community... But nothing really happened. Except for a bursuary for a student in need (1000$) and housing on-campus, I received no support whatsoever. Nobody explained to me how the university works. Nobody told me what the requirements are in fact. Nobody tried to incorporate me to any social events. Nobody offered any help. Now, there are programs. Back then, I was all alone, with anxiety kicking in and semi-breaking-in depression, still trying to organise some social events that hardly gathered interest. I understood the exclusion with time. But I learned to see it as an even more negative thing as what we do at Design, has a great deal to do with empathy. I received none. And miraculously managed to survive the first year.<br><br>

	Considering the circumstances I felt that this might have been an even larger accomplishment in my life. I just wish I was taught much more in the process, though, which I felt I wasn't. After the first year, though, I had to do my research beforehand but I had to get into the exchange. I learned of it somehow and grew very interested. I balanced on the verge of being eligible at all. And once I learned of the opportunity and the associated scholarships, I pushed ahead like crazy. To the point I broke through the distinction average in the end and acted like a locomotive in whichever group I was, taking upon myself a great deal of work. Even if I made mistakes, which I know I did and a quite a huge lot, in the end the work was perceived. And the exchange opportunity did happen in very weird circumstances. Again, I did not get what I wanted. I wanted to go to McGill, to Canada. That was my first preference. As second, came LMU - University of Munich. I felt so sad when I learned of the news. Petrified, that I needed to prove my German skills. One in which I was absolute, disgracefully oblivious to. My skills were much worse than of any of the subjects I have participated during both my secondary school and high school. I didn't enjoy learning this at all, despite that my teacher was a good teacher indeed. Now I had to not only cope with my semester (still inbound and me locomotivating..) but also learn B1 German in nearly just 2 months. Crazily desperate that my chance might be slipping away, I introduced a very consistent system into motion. German at the university. German on my computer, on my smartphone. German, consistently german. There was german everywhere.<br><br>

	In the end, I received only half of the B1 certificate. LMU was happy with it. In the end, I received a bungalow with en-suite everything: kitchen, bathroom, balcony, living room and bedroom for 11 months. I didn't receive a merit scholarship. But I received OS Help, amounting to 13000$ in total. I had issues in the process of getting my social benefits of youth allowance. This was a worry but in the end I received roughly 450$ fortnightly and a one-time 4000$ relocation scholarship. That was all planned, except for the relocation scholarship. OS Help was a loan I'll repay back once I start earning money. But the fact I'd be receiving 9100 Euros in total, throughout my stay in Germany? I'll put it differently, how would you feel if someone told you you'd be receiving 15000$ for the next 11 months? Well, yes, mentally I took it surprisingly well. I allocated my money towards rent, using my strong AUD at the time. I put a bit towards furniture, food, transport... and travelling, economically by bus roaming Europe. And I managed to save a bit. And complete part of my core units while I was on exchange. At one of the best universities (if not the best) in Germany. I knew at this time I would never end up with any better arrangement. The lectures were great. Very demanding as well. I did my best to do everything I could to make sure I took the most out of it and put my life on track and create a safety net. Because this accomplishment felt... in just one way. I felt I didn't deserve it and it did not match the skills I could provide. This was particularly depressing and this drilled and even deeper hole as I fell in an unreciprocated love. I guess paradise can easily turn into one blandly scorching kind-of-a-hell.<br><br>

    <center><h4>German?</h4></center>

	I think the experience did hit me quite heavily, though. I remained reserved for a lot of time, despite that people were all very friendly and eventually I managed to get to know quite a lot. Many great people and had a real wonderful time. Because of my depressing part and how unhappy I was and just primarily how crazy, ridiculous, way beyond sane scenario played out with the exchange experience, I felt like matching it and committed myself to quite a bit of travelling. In the end that depleted a bit of my money but in the end I should have done twice as much. You don't get a second youth. And I was reminded a few times by the friends I made, that I managed, to get myself, at such a young age, to such a good university and travel and do so much. Many thought, I just had rich parents but I told them, I was on a scholarship. I never told anyone of the extent of it. And despite all of this, I did some extra volunteer work, some of which was partially reimbursed. I even was given money by my family in Poland, despite I constantly reminded them, that I really don't need it. I was quite right on many levels to do many of the things I did. I was quite right about me not being on the same level. Mind you, the system in Munich was radically different from what I experienced in Sydney. For a change, exams were here. For a change, I was doing at first: Master level subjects and then the following, Bachelor level subjects lead in German. This was a mission impossible and I became petrified about the financial means directed towards me. But I think my results have proven to go contrary to what even I believed. Despite all my daredevil trips made to counteract my psychological struggles and all of everything, I completed successfully 66 ECTS points. This was the largest accomplishment in my life, which I did not share with anyone except my family. And they did help me when I needed it. For which I am greatful. But along the years I feel the achievement dissapated. It was not recognised really back in Sydney. I did not share it one hand. But I am, I'd say absolutely certain, that nobody else was on better conditions that I was. To get scholarships even closely remotely to what I received, there are such programs but restricted to a great extent. You'll need to go through interviews... processess... competitive process. I was just told I'm getting a scholarship. I never knew I'd be getting the money. I never knew how this exchange would look like. I wanted something else. But I received something much better instead. I think I took it very level-headed... But I think I also squandered it to a portion. I could have done twice as much and made much more out of it. And it's all gone now.<br><br>

	What I came back with was ambition. Late by 2 weeks to the uni. Clash with a quite badly lead material. Me, overloading for the end of semester. Again, I was not told what's expected and what I should aim for really. Little support. Problems with team members. Adjusting from exam-based work to project-based work. 3 hours per day of travel time to uni, compared to ~25-30 minutes in total in Munich. Expensive food at sometimes questionnable quality compared to cheap and good food. My father, not doing anything, again. Bland four walls, little to no social life. Tons of work to substitute the emptiness for. It all lead to... nowhere. I finished my degree at 73. Kind of good but I was hoping to break the distinction average of 75. Then I had problems with my transcript and my graduation was postponed by a year. There are not too many options that I could have done in this case... I was recommended a few options. Considering I might choose Europe one day, I settled for a Master's program, MIDEA.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Ridiculous</h4></center>

	You know, the thing that I take as ridiculous is how much can change in such a short time-span. This is something I admire and yearn for, change is always good. If nothing changes, you can't improve, can you now? I treated MIDEA as a natural extension of the program with no idea of how will I lead it. Should I do the courses again? Like Design Thinking which I did badly bad in the days? Can I do another exchange? What should I do? Will I be doing the exact same things? I was sort of a prodigy here, nobody does a Master's degree after a Bachelor's in the same field because it is literally the same. Makes no sense and even the lecturers did not see this as reasonable. I felt it was, it is a specific prestige that employers in Europe do see as so. But, like I mentioned, it is different in Australia. And that went surprisingly well. Except, that I felt I was doing the majority of the work for the last submissions. I don't want to take any effort made by my team members, one of whom did have a great contribution. But at this stage, I felt really bad with how the assessments were conducted... Just unjust. Such a situation should have never taken place, it blew black very negatively on me, despite that what that semester taught me, was that I actually had the skills and can really bring to life quite intricate projects. I mean, developing a system based on Arduino and Android? A fully working one? In the end, I received pretty good marks... I didn't quite get as such for the other unit, which I should have dropped. I ended up burnt out, with another this time short-term exchange scheduled. With yet again, another favorite experience. Amazing people. Everything amazing, except for some parts. And one main one, that I developed feelings, again. I think partially, actually reciprocated with just me, not really doing anything about it. This actually kept me strong. Until this short-exchange fulfilled its span and everyone left to where they continued on living. I am 22 at this point and feeling that... well, this was one opportunity in which I should have actually created something just as interesting and elaborate as I have been living for the past few years. I also had another exchange lined up. And I was sent an email, that I can't participate in it, because of my degree constraints. Fucking faculty services... Once I sent back my pleasant but firm response, I got an acceptance within the next 15 minutes. That's why I think my luck is bi-polar. I keep making decisions but never really get to experience what I yearned for... and get something better instead. But never really maximize what I'll get in return... it just... sort of rolls over.<br><br>

	I'm not quite sure how to put this. Let's just say that if I did nothing I would probably end up nowhere. I ended up nominated somewhere, which some people know. But my parents don't. And they do not treat this opportunity as something of such calibre. In fact, I don't myself really, because of how beyond it feels. The choice was made, because nobody advise me against it. I consulted this a few times, because it could not happen but what if I just put it there? Just as in, calling out the devil himself, saying I'd like a ride to beyond and aforementioned. And so, friends don't know what I got into. Not that many do. Nobody really knows and I did not a few years ago. A friend, who interned at Google, she wanted to go but didn't cause she was told, it's SCA-restricted. Parsons... I just saw a presentation for Design at Dusk recently. They did a project related to health and went to New York to present at MoMA. And they went specifically to Parsons too, not to study, though. Now, I was told that usually they receive 10-20 applications... That I will have to really specify why I want to go there... That America might say no because I didn't do a 4 year bachelor course... my friend again, from Google, is doing honours just so she can meet the 4-year degree requirement and work in the US. There were so many moving parts that finally aligned... to me, to be nominated to the US nr. 1 Art & Design university. Among 4 other nominated and I'm pretty sure I'm the only one from outside SCA, that is fine art school/faculty. I don't know what the future holds. I have no idea how it will turn out. Everything can happen to me really. With the nomination and other things. But what I know is, I'm taking this nomination very bad.<br><br>

	I could have gone to Texas, I could have gone to Washington. With an average of 80, I could probably go anywhere I wanted to. Parsons was the least expected destination. Back in Munich, I felt I was nobody. I had the absolute freedom to shape who I wanted to be and never achieved this. Now, Parsons seems like a shot that is entirely one of a kind. Finalising my degree with this will be something that will be beyond of the word describing what beyond is. But the problem remains, that this nomination feels underappreciated by everyone around. Nobody knows really the volume of where I... I'm sitting in between these four walls. Sad. Crumbling. My dad next door. Watching his shows. Doing nothing. Constantly. I have research to do. But instead I end up not doing it. I can't communicate properly. I don't feel valued. I don't feel related. Just sour. Depressed. Anxious. Unable. Remorseful and without that spark I had when I was leaving Poland quite a while back. And that spark when I was leaving Korea. That spark that felt as if I was alive. Even back in Germany. Luck is bi-polar.<br><br>
