<center><h4>Coming Up Next!</h4></center>

<p>As I was successfully accepted to Parsons and managed to get myself to a point from which it would require skill to revert back to square one, I started thinking 'what after?'. Well, there are a few units of study that I am thinking about taking, all revolving around the idea of completing yet another exchange, although this time it would likely be at a lesser caliber</p>

<p>So far I managed to narrow down to, practically: three options. One decision and obvious, second passionately driven and third domestically international. I could also summarise it differently in a split of metaphors but I ain't got any simple ones at my disposal. All I'll say, it will all come down to gambling with my own life but at this point I kind of got used to this</p>

  </div><br>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 panel">
  <center><h4>Prequel</h4></center>

<p>But let's start from the very start. I mean, you all must be wondering, what are my motivations? What are my goals? How did I even end up with myself considering to actually get where I meant to? Did I even in the first place? These and more questions, very valid. And even I wondered, perhaps I could have considered going there way earlier, during my Bachelor's perhaps. And something tells me, that no. I managed to get it all performed optimally, to the point it should with some loose ends on the way but that I'll say.</p>

<p>The very first time I heard of Parsons was during me scanning as usual the also usual banter going on on the facebook group chat from the Design Computing course. At some point, one soul discovered that oh, the exchange team actually offers the ability to pick Parsons as a destination. At which point I was, 'what's Parsons?'. This is something that keeps ringing in my mind actually and in fact many of the academics don't know Parsons and in the industry and students alike. Myself included and in the end people just gave up, as well as the soul that mentioned it. Just because it rang as a 'SCA faculty restricted agreement'. That didn't change, as well as the fact that Parsons did top the rank of art & design schools, in America and second in the world. Well, the rank sort of wobbled a bit and I had different priorities at the time, along with the strong feeling, that heck I'm screwed by going to Germany. Which eventually proved me right and very wrong, as that was one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life.</p>

<p>Once I've graduated and people knew I was about to do Master's, they were quite frank asking me 'why am I doing Master's'. There were multiple, I felt as good reasons. One of which, was the ability to go on exchange again. I felt, yeah, this time gonna be America. But once I did roll into the degree, I discovered one of the first mines on my pathway... well, there was another: do I have to do the first year subjects or not? Three of them, I've already done, actually just two: Design Thinking and Design Programming, Interface Design too but I had this title done already in Germany... after consulting the academia, I received a nay, maybe and yay. But my program director said, you can do electives. And I proposed I could go on exchange instead. And she said, I could. So that settled one thing.</p>

<p>The other was much more troubling. Turns out? Many of the exchange destinations are off limits for postgraduate students... in fact, most of the destinations! I really wanted to go to Canada. But Canada had very limited options and with the addition of American universities, the list turned out as very short! In addition, I couldn't find many design-related courses in Canada, so that limited me to the US. And there, I had at-most 12 universities to choose from but! Apparently, many would not consider me due to my Bachelor's Degree being only 3 years long! Many apparently require a minimum of 4 years! Imagine how screwed I felt at this point, with Bachelor students having a garganteous amount of a whooping I believe over 300 destinations to choose from and postgraduate, only sharing a piece of this chunk. Still an impressive chunk. And so I decided to complement it with a short-term exchange somewhere... but again, there was a limit of where I could go, closing to... practically, one destination in Korea. For post-graduate research students and I was doing coursework. And that's... my friends, how I ended up in the top technical university in Korea... KAIST.</p>

<p>Still, I had to figure out my long-term plans in the first semester too. And the next, mines actually, was the semester itself, very engaging, difficult, lots of constant and neverending work... unforgiving work. And somehow in the very middle of all my brain melting, I even think I managed to get partially blinded on one eye for over a month or so following after the semester, that's how difficult the semester was. And still I managed to throw in a bit of time to figure out my exchange options, speak to some faculty members and the sydney abroad team and probe whether and where I could go... discovering a lot of interesting aspects. And inquire actually, would it be possible to go to Parsons? I inquired two people from Sydney Abroad. Neither told me to not apply. It was still SCA restricted agreement, so the chances were very slim. And I was told 10-20 people usually apply there too. So I figured, I'll just chuck it at the top, once I found there were potentially good courses in it, matching my profile... and included Washington and Texas to follow... which I've inverted as I found more interesting and complementary subjects at Parsons. And I discovered plenty on the way, for instance that Washington is different to Washington D.C.... but well.</p>

<p>I applied on time. And I think it was a close call here too, as the deadline was closing in very shortly. I received the information I got in to KAIST, which required not that much paperwork, although some still. Sometime in the middle of the semester, which was a very positive thing I needed. And evetually off I went.</p>

    <center><h4>Progressing</h4></center>

<p>At KAIST I received following blows. Okay, I received good marks for the first semester, although for one, it was excruciatingly underwhelming. But it couldn't compare to the email I received from faculty services, the one almost jeopardising my next venture email, which came in out of the blue and luckily at a time I could actually answer it promptly. My beloved faculty services, the one that managed to postpone my graduation by a year. They said I was not eligible for an exchange because... I didn't have enough credits. Stunned but especially in such cases, dreadfully motivated and poignantly disciplined I crafted a concise, up-to-the-point clear response, attaching sydney abroad and my program director, showcasing my arguments detailing how I received the required permissions, have more-than-sufficient electives left and my lack of comprehension for why I received a denial instead of a clearly eligible for exchange approval. Contrary to what faculty services usually does, which is providing answers a month later which would practically demolish my aspiration to go on exchange anytime soon, the reply came 15 minutes later with apologies and an approval. Very close call... I don't even know if anyone intervened. Perhaps someone did. Either way, again everyone CC'd I hoped it got through to the necessary people as decisions regarding my long-term exchange were to come in just a few weeks now at most...</p>

<p>Once I came back, I got right into the research mood. And I actually began looking into other universities Texas and Washington as I truly did not believe Parsons would accept me. Somehow, I believe sometime at week 5, or perhaps.. actually around my first presentation, I decided to take a peek, like hey, sydney abroad said they would start making decisions early and some of us would get to know sooner than some. I checked actually a few times, not to often... then there was a break and I just figured, eh... I'll just take a look. And I could've sworn something changed. Cause instead of something generic, Sydney Abroad called, it was... Parsons. Which could mean one of two things: I was already nominated or just the top preference was put there. I figured it could be the second option... Then I was quite stunned for 2 weeks and even longer, questioning myself 'what does it mean?' 'Am I really that good?' 'Is it real?'. Two weeks after I checked, I did get an email that the decision was made. And it was Parsons. This just blew my spectrum out of what I had. Something beyond comprehension that I could not understand. Which is sad frankly. But it did happen and up next I had to make sure I received the school's approval and I figured, yeah, nomination, cool beans. But to get the school to approve me? Fuck, I have no idea how that's going to happen... But people usually nominated to end up there so I figured, should be fine, right?</p>

<p>And there goes another mine... As Parsons requested a full batch of everything. All my transcripts. My CV. My portfolio! They required a bloody portfolio! Which kind of makes sense? But I had only a digital one and I had to come up with a new one ASAP. Hold that thought. I had other issues before. I was supposed to receive instructions from Parsons and they didn't come until the very last minute. Literally 3-4 days before application deadline as I pressed my exchange advisor very lightly on the matter that I received nothing from Parsons. So another mine which came with a cluster of following mines. As I received an application for a Bachelor exchange... Which didn't even work at first. Then it did but it turned out that actually, there was another application for Master students on exchange. Which required a different portfolio type, at which point I gave up and provided what I worked on for hours. Also I wanted to choose Communication Design program... but it was not available, only Design & Technology. Literally all my emails between Parsons and me, included an apology on their side. And I had to divert at times a lot of my attention towards refining my own website and crafting a brand new portfolio from scratch. Also I needed a letter of intent. This was massive, considering I only had a few days (!!!!!) to get all done in proper fashion, right in the middle of my capstone research (thesis) project. I truly wanted myself to shine but with how tired I already was... I figured, yeah, this time I won't pull through. I didn't receive a confirmation either so after sometime I requested it, as in the application it said I would get a response in 2 days. It took over a month instead... and I was delivered an additional mine as I had to fill in a very alike application form again. At first google forms based and now an internal on Parsons website, which had some tough points to fill in as well. I figured time was of the essence so I just filled it in as best to my knowledge.</p>

<p>I received an update 2 weeks later wih just a student ID but just that I've applied and that's my student number. Over a week later, I was officially notified that indeed I have been accepted. To say the admission process took a semester would not be an understatement. To say it was difficult to get through all these steps would not be an overstatement. I received the news on the day of the yearly graduation show. I was actually full of holes at the time, as I received two massive blows academically and in my private life. I don't think I would have survived a third blow with a rejection from Parsons but that remaining a stalemate just was a particular stagnacy-pain. I even thought whether I should go wear festive for this even without me knowing whether I was accepted or not. But because I was, I felt this one gorgeous stream of bliss. That one that truly gleams as this ray of beauty. I was just accepted by the best art school in America. I got through that many mines. Okay, what next?</p>

    <center><h4>Treading on</h4></center>

	<p>Well, nothing was next. I was told to wait and take a look at some information + I was assigned an academic advisor whom I sent a message but I did not get back to eventually until later once I exchanged emails with my newschool email address. Anyway, I had to sign and return some admission-related documents and things started progressing on a daily basis. I received limited access to my.newschool account and was asked to pay 500U$ deposit... I was like, do I really? The next day, I was sent an email that I have full access to the account now but still the matter was unclear. I sent a few emails and it turned out the deposit is a tuition deposit and as a matter of fact, I'm not required to pay for tuition, then it's all in order. I had to apply for housing but the application would not work, once I called them they said I had to issue the deposit first. I contacted the IT department and they said, I'd get access to most services in 48h but to housing within 10 days... Priority deadline for housing was on 3rd of December, I had to lodge it few days later once the system was reset by ISSS, a body handling many visa related matters. Beforehand, I gained access to an email address, followed within days by additional services. Parsons works on a modular basis, sustaining each semi-independently. But it doesn't always work as intended and some services like registration, didn't work for days... and again, the registration kicked off on the 3rd of December. I didn't have access, though.</p>

  <p>And I didn't have access until the 15th of December once I contacted by phone my academic advisor as proposed, although the matter was broached over a week prior. At this point, most courses were already closed or with a waitlist attached... Some mines did blow up as it turned out. Also, the talk with my academic advisor was very strange on my end as I was not able to communicate properly due to me not exactly knowing what questions I was supposed to ask. In parallel I had to take care of my visa-related matters and in this regards I was speeding. At first the portal did not work and had to be reset by the staff. The resolution came within 5 days after I notified ISSS. Then there was a lot of details to fill in, some questions tricky. I had to showcase many sensitive details about myself and... most problematic part: financial documentation. The details were unclear in regards to how much money would I need to show for the approval to go through so I asked and... I was told I needed a minimum of <b>14,213U$</b>. That was bad news. Firstly, the AUD was bad and I had bit of expenditures during my previous semesters. Secondly, I just didn't have enough money on my account even if converged with how much my parent could support me with... I would however, once I showcased what I would get in the foreseeable future. Still, I had to postpone filing this in as I needed a translation of one document and to collect a variety of bank statements from my bank accounts. If there was anything that I could crash against, that would be the financial part, which still diverged from what the amounts showcased in the document they sent me: ~12000USD.</p>

  <p>Another worry was that the processing of the application takes 15 business days, excluding weekends and holidays. Well, Christmas was coming... so I figured, it's impossible to get it done before Christmas then. But once I filled all the information in express manner with the addition of setting up an account to get the document sent from the states to my place down under, with the application for sending the document being as rigid as the other forms... My first key form, DS-2019 was surprisingly approved (despite the financial long-shot) on the 11th and sent by UPS, which was delivered from the states... on the 13th! For which I paid a hefty fine of 65.5 U$!!! But at least it came on time and now I could start applying for the visa. This was probably the most fucked up part.</p>

  <p>I have never gone through such a comprehensive application in my life. Let's start with fees. First of all, I had to pay SEVIS fee. That's 180U$ and I'll actually include the 65.5U$ cause otherwise, I wouldn't get the DS-2019 at all. Then, I had to schedule a Visa Interview. Finding the right website for doing this was not easy. But... I couldn't lodge an application just yet, I had to apply for a nonimmigrant visa. That required a new photos, so I started by taking one on my own and post-processing it according to the guidelines set... which returned errors so I couldn't find the right examples and had to do workarounds with google-fu to see what used to be on the hyperlinks showcased by US Department of State that did not exist anymore. Once I took an appropriate photo and post-processed it and their internal system said it's good then I started the application... Which probably asked every single question that there was. The passports I'm using, where I've travelled in the last 5 years, my employment and academic history, seriously everything, even whether I'm a terrorist, have experience with chemical weapons and alike. Once that was done, I could schedule an appointment... on a different website and had to pay 160U$ for scheduling the appointment. And later on I had to pay 105U$ reciprocity fee... Let's sum it up: 510.5 U$. In the meantime, before I even got the visa approved I gambled and bought a ticket to the U$ for 585AUD, I figured I'd never get a better deal, which came and went every now and then... Do you get it? I paid less for the flight compared to all the stuff required for the visa. To top it off with, it was an extremely comprehensive application. In the end however, I managed to set up an appointment on the 20th of December at... 8:25. The only possible time, on other days, the time ranged between 8 and 10 and it takes an hour and a half from where I live to reach the consulate. And this was an interview I was attending. During this interview I could have been asked all sorts of questions and I had to be able to prove anything I have stated: my academic record, ties to my home country and financial means which seemed like the most pressing issue of all... This was one mine that I thought I would not be able to dodge.</p>

  <p>I managed to print a complete file of all the information I needed. And I went to the area... but as the consulate does not allow any electronic devices, I came in blind and had a bit of problem locating the consulate which was located in a highrise building, which I located after asking around. I was notified that they only take cash on this day so I went looking for an ATM downstairs... and came back, where I was asked some questions, asked to provide some key documents, screened, went through additional security checkpoints and then after going through a few queues, I had my fingerprints taken, my passport checked, then took a ticket, waited for a few minutes and had an interview... I wasn't sure what I would be asked, I saw some people being questioned quite rigorously. Then my turn. My fingerprints were checked. I was asked what's my name. Where I'm going to study. What's the name of the school. For how long will I study there. Where do I study now and what's my major. Then I was printed a receipt, told to go pay to another window where I paid, got my change and asked to return to the same officer. I still had to wait, as there were two other people waiting to the same window, I presented my passport and receipt and was notified that my visa was approved and will be sent within 3 days. In fact it was already being sent the day after and now it's held up by the shipping company due to holidays. But my passport will arrive eventually. And now everything's set up. Am I now free to go? Not exactly</p>

    <center><h4>Loose Ends</h4></center>

    <p>Let me enumerate the loose ends. Housing, Registration, Courses, Insurance, Flights and Work. I'll start with housing: living in New York is crazy expensive. I might get it, I might not. If I don't, it's not a disaster as I might have alternatives. But I'm also going to have an experience... Is it worth paying 1350U$ monthly, though? Registration is not finished, although technically it is, I still had to submit a photo for my newcard and send an immunization form... which was due on the 15th and nobody told me about it! One vaccination had to be made, which is not refunded by the government and cost me 60AU$. I still didn't get a response from Parsons yet. In case of courses, I managed to enrol in a few units and then get through a few waitlists but some courses I'm still counting on getting in and that I will have to sort early January which will be sort of a Free For All. I don't know how it will turn out but the courses I'm in already seem very enticing, in fact I am extremely impressed by what Parsons offers to its students in these terms.</p>

    <p>Insurance was a big question mark for me. I'm not sure I am ready to pay 2167U$ for insurance for just a semester... Nobody told me anything about it but then I eventually received an email that yes, I need to pay for it and yes, the electronic billing system says that's how much I need to pay. So I started thinking, maybe I can dodge this bullet... How much does insurance cost for AU students? I am insured by the university but just in case... less than 150 days would be... the most expensive, Platinum tier and... for the duration it would be 1329AU$... If it was over 150 days it would be 1538AU$. Then I read there are cheaper tiers for students over 40% cheaper. So 797.4AU$ and 922.8AU$ depending on the under/over 150 day length. This was already significantly cheaper... But I figured, maybe I can waive it altogether so I compared what the insurers offer, as I needed to have similar insurance... and then I proceeded to the waiver form which turned out to be... quite straightforward, so I filled in the details of the insurer and my details... and I also read that Master students can completely not enrol into the health services... I submitted the application and foresaw that they might want proof... which for now did not come. Instead, the amount due payable was not on my electronic payment website anymore. This was a massive success. Also, for housing I had to issue a non-refundable 350U$ deposit. And then flights... I have one-way ticket. I need another one to Europe, or somewhere else, depending whether I will want to travel afterwards. I'm allowed to take 2 pieces of checked in luggage which I plan to use... Then I'll have to take this back to Aus and/or Europe. So it's getting complicated. But most of the stuff is already out of the way... To New York, it's Hawaiian and it cost only 585AU$ with Sta Travel.</p>

    <p>I order to get the most of my status I had to also postpone my flights until the very last day of when I can actually get to the states, so I'll be missing orientation unfortunately. Apparently mandatory... Then again, still plenty of stuff to take care of before I depart. It's incredible that I managed to pull all of this weight in such a short timespan. And I'm getting increasingly hyped for what's to come + I'll be needing additional information about New York, perhaps there are ways to minimise the costs as well. We'll see... Also I will have forms to fill upon my arrival, screening at the airports and have to look for work to get extra bucks and finally experience on my CV. So yeah, it's not the end but closer to getting in.</p>

    <center><h4>Ridiculous</h4></center>

	You know, the thing that I take as ridiculous is how much can change in such a short time-span. This is something I admire and yearn for, change is always good. If nothing changes, you can't improve, can you now? I treated MIDEA as a natural extension of the program with no idea of how will I lead it. Should I do the courses again? Like Design Thinking which I did badly bad in the days? Can I do another exchange? What should I do? Will I be doing the exact same things? I was sort of a prodigy here, nobody does a Master's degree after a Bachelor's in the same field because it is literally the same. Makes no sense and even the lecturers did not see this as reasonable. I felt it was, it is a specific prestige that employers in Europe do see as so. But, like I mentioned, it is different in Australia. And that went surprisingly well. Except, that I felt I was doing the majority of the work for the last submissions. I don't want to take any effort made by my team members, one of whom did have a great contribution. But at this stage, I felt really bad with how the assessments were conducted... Just unjust. Such a situation should have never taken place, it blew black very negatively on me, despite that what that semester taught me, was that I actually had the skills and can really bring to life quite intricate projects. I mean, developing a system based on Arduino and Android? A fully working one? In the end, I received pretty good marks... I didn't quite get as such for the other unit, which I should have dropped. I ended up burnt out, with another this time short-term exchange scheduled. With yet again, another favorite experience. Amazing people. Everything amazing, except for some parts. And one main one, that I developed feelings, again. I think partially, actually reciprocated with just me, not really doing anything about it. This actually kept me strong. Until this short-exchange fulfilled its span and everyone left to where they continued on living. I am 22 at this point and feeling that... well, this was one opportunity in which I should have actually created something just as interesting and elaborate as I have been living for the past few years. I also had another exchange lined up. And I was sent an email, that I can't participate in it, because of my degree constraints. Fucking faculty services... Once I sent back my pleasant but firm response, I got an acceptance within the next 15 minutes. That's why I think my luck is bi-polar. I keep making decisions but never really get to experience what I yearned for... and get something better instead. But never really maximize what I'll get in return... it just... sort of rolls over.<br><br>

	I'm not quite sure how to put this. Let's just say that if I did nothing I would probably end up nowhere. I ended up nominated somewhere, which some people know. But my parents don't. And they do not treat this opportunity as something of such calibre. In fact, I don't myself really, because of how beyond it feels. The choice was made, because nobody advise me against it. I consulted this a few times, because it could not happen but what if I just put it there? Just as in, calling out the devil himself, saying I'd like a ride to beyond and aforementioned. And so, friends don't know what I got into. Not that many do. Nobody really knows and I did not a few years ago. A friend, who interned at Google, she wanted to go but didn't cause she was told, it's SCA-restricted. Parsons... I just saw a presentation for Design at Dusk recently. They did a project related to health and went to New York to present at MoMA. And they went specifically to Parsons too, not to study, though. Now, I was told that usually they receive 10-20 applications... That I will have to really specify why I want to go there... That America might say no because I didn't do a 4 year bachelor course... my friend again, from Google, is doing honours just so she can meet the 4-year degree requirement and work in the US. There were so many moving parts that finally aligned... to me, to be nominated to the US nr. 1 Art & Design university. Among 4 other nominated and I'm pretty sure I'm the only one from outside SCA, that is fine art school/faculty. I don't know what the future holds. I have no idea how it will turn out. Everything can happen to me really. With the nomination and other things. But what I know is, I'm taking this nomination very bad.<br><br>

	I could have gone to Texas, I could have gone to Washington. With an average of 80, I could probably go anywhere I wanted to. Parsons was the least expected destination. Back in Munich, I felt I was nobody. I had the absolute freedom to shape who I wanted to be and never achieved this. Now, Parsons seems like a shot that is entirely one of a kind. Finalising my degree with this will be something that will be beyond of the word describing what beyond is. But the problem remains, that this nomination feels underappreciated by everyone around. Nobody knows really the volume of where I... I'm sitting in between these four walls. Sad. Crumbling. My dad next door. Watching his shows. Doing nothing. Constantly. I have research to do. But instead I end up not doing it. I can't communicate properly. I don't feel valued. I don't feel related. Just sour. Depressed. Anxious. Unable. Remorseful and without that spark I had when I was leaving Poland quite a while back. And that spark when I was leaving Korea. That spark that felt as if I was alive. Even back in Germany. Luck is bi-polar.<br><br>
