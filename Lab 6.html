The first challenge was to connect the Processing sketch with an Arduino board. One method everyone used was firmata, however, since I have allergy to firmata (it does not work with many libraries) out of the box, I decided to reuse the code I developed a week ago, which utilised a fully working serial communication between an Arduino, Processing sketch and Max 7 via OCP/UDP protocols. Once I recreated my steps, I was able to have a fully functioning visualisation manipulator in motion, based on the distance the ultrasonic sensor picked up. The effect was subliminal, but relatively surprising at the same time<br><br>

The largest challenge came once I had to involve an analyzer plugin, one that would be able to analyze any song possible, break it down to specific features with which I would be able to control visualisations more elaborately. Unfortunately, I never managed to get the plugin working. I looked for solutions on the web, however, despite having broached quite a few discussion boards, I was never able to get the plugin working nor find a suitable alternative, sadly<br><br>

I was able to introduce a serial communication and an OSC/UDP protocol between Max, Processing and Arduino and successfully manipulate a processing sketch by picking up information from a variety of Arduino modules<br><br>

I have also explored a variety of filters and ways of breaking down songs, along with rediscovering the existance of the very same filters available on PC, although sadly not working at this time<br><br>

I was not able to analyze data from any song due to a plugin compatibility-related issue and spend most of the time in class trying to figure out how to get it properly installed and working on my PC, as the Mac I was stationed at did not work at all, unfortunately.<br><br>

Despite having found an equivalent that should have worked on PCs, it eventually didn't. Most likely due to the requirements targetting a Windows 7 PC, as some of the files that had to be altered were derived from previous setups, not suitable for my current system<br><br>

I would not have done anything differently actually, except perhaps, if needed, bought a Macintosh computer and worked on it, as apparently analyzer did eventually launch on this particular brand. That having said, I probably would have dedicated more time into finding an equivalent music-analyzing plugin or perhaps a legitimate solution. It might be the case that the plugin will not work in windows-based computers with the newest Max installed, plugins can be quite difficult to work with when they're not updated for quite some time.<br><br>

It certainly does in a few dimensions. One of our ideas was to include a projection mapping placed underneath the umbrella. In fact, any projection mapping being showcased could potentially be manipulated with data included. Furthermore, we are involving sounds in our project, ie. nature sounds, which could potentially be analyzed via Max with sensors pitching another dimensions affecting specific visualisations.<br><br>

To be honest, the potential applications are endless, however we need to consider the complexity of our project, as we were frequently reminded to not make it too complicated. Moreover, we are concentrating on addressing real user-needs bound with the area, in such case we will focus on tweaking these. That having said, we will keep in mind the affordances provided by the implication of Max and OSC/UDP protocols to send data back and forth. Despite that it may end up being a relatively tiring process, the gains are substantial, as it could even work remotely over a server if needed. With sensors properly installed, a simple IOT system could be established, although the question remains of how useful would it be for our project?<br><br>

Well, the exercise could involve more sensors to begin with. Secondly, the visualisations could be more straightforward as to suggest direct user feedback, which it did not quite suggest throughout the entire session. Perhaps integrating the system with OpenCV could emerge with quite a few particularly interesting use cases, although at this point we would be working with such a multitude of dimensions that the effect a user could impose would eventually not be quite visible as we would have intended as.<br><br>

It may be a different story if we involved more precise or a cluster of sensors. It all really comes down to the sensors really, as the communication could be even established via regular cables. Nevertheless it is just interesting to see how easy/intricate a system can be and through the lenses of our projects and the Lab's tutorials consider how other, potentially imaginary and visionary projects such as Amazon's shop in which you don't have to scan any products, you just pick them up and leave with Amazon automatically charging for the products, can conceptually be implemented. Broadening the horizons and showcasing more possibilities along with functions and the technical implementation is useful to comprehend phenomena taking place around us, as well as being able to contribute to a variety of potential projects.<br><br>

All in all, I feel the tutorials in which we were taught how to communicate between devices were substantial. On one hand we need to know which sensors to use in order to evaluate and directly relate to a problem. And then see how we could solve it via communication and technical implementation means and provide a positive impact on the users.<br><br>

    So, here I am, back with Arduino. After a few attempts, one minor, one prompt, one challenging and now the one, in a way ubiquitous, theoretically more constrained, yet potentially more potent to bring technology out to the open and make sure people actually interact and become healthier. In a way I was not entirely into 'designing for wellbeing' concept, while I agree with it and believe there is a strong need for it, I feel that it might not be my thing, ya know? However, one thing I did however manage to connect with and to and it all started back in around 2013, when I felt a strong drive for the redevelopment of my hometown, to which I had to commute for pretty much everyday. Whether to attend my high school classes, or to meet with friends - but the infrastruture did not really support either. So that's probably when my UX story really started, despite me not knowing the techniques, I already have utilized quite a few: Background research, target user interviews, low-fidelity sketches, later on mockups. The number one issue that I have commited to, intended no-misuse on my side, was that I went streight into developing ideas, instead of consulting it with others. At that time I was like, 'whom am I going to consult it with? Barely anybody knew what I was doing as a hobby. And nobody really would in fact approve it unless it was potentially good.' And so it remained a secret and never went beyond the defining stage. Since then, I believe it was only Vivid, which surprisingly became something that I started believing in the work that one may be conducting in terms of enriching the surrounding environment. And now, a factual 18 credit point subject, utilizing a number of areas that I have been dedicated to: Product Design, Sound Design, UX, Interface Design... what does it not utilize really? Arduino, Processing, Product making comes into play and the project will likely evolve way beyond that. Now that I consider as quite beautiful.<br><br>

Nevertheless, what I was told to do here, was really showcase and reflect on how I did and would likely prefer to perform futurewise. So first of all, I am in possession of a new computer system, therefore all of my software was not installed to begin with. I had to download Arduino and Processing softwares. Then my arduino kit was still stranded on the semi-failed weightscale project, very likely due to the dodgy arduino kit that I have (Sparkfun unit). After all, I constructed my device in a way, that it was relatively easy to disassemble. However, it turned out that my cable was stuck inside, therefore I had to fiddle with breaking it out. I had to apply some pressure and I didn't manage to free it out without breaking the structure a bit. But that's okay, I may recycle it someday, I guess. Then another issue came to my mind: what do I do now? Well, I went straight into trying to get something working. So I followed the sparkfun tutorial for launching my RGB LED and, it worked. So I figured: hey! Maybe I'll bind a processing code to the arduino kit? And there I made an attempt. A quite successful one. Nevertheless, I crashed on the Serial.write() bit, as unfortunately serialized code does not quite work well when you wish to send a few separate info. Too bad, so I figured, well, maybe I could do something more physical, then?<br><br>

And so I did! Four buttons, according to my concept, the yellow would unlock the ground pin. And the other: red, green, blue; would just activate each. It didn't take much fidling, as it was just the buttons, that work as a connector itself. This is some cool stuff, easy peasy, but still cool. Along the way I found out that it's absolutely okay to use the RGB LED without any resistors, the same goes for the buttons. Cause what would they be needed for? They just carry on the electricity further, when pressed that is. The very next thing was to see whether both of the methods for launching the RGB LED work. Buttons worked. The processing code, after a few fixes: started to work as well. So there it is. Now I have an interesting foundation, although still am in need of some ways of sending data two-way. Hey, perhaps via bluetooth finally? So next step: Firmata.<br><br>
