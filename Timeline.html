I produced a great deal, 65 blog entries yet only 5(6) were eventually published, as I was not content with the quality of language in which I drove these blogs. Yet, I continued. For 3 years.

Then I grew bored as I usually prefer to take one shot at a blog, then 2 commencing which would refine the existing thing. Trying to fit all of the aforementioned in small steps seemed right, but that was not my style. (2012-2014)</p>

        <p>I had an idea. I went with a friend for a bike ride and some KFC bite. We ended up above the, still being constructed, Warsaw's southern ring expressway bypass. I took a few pictures, as I grew being an addict of taking photos and then, once I reviewed them at home, an idea went through my head. What if I made it... as if there was an apocalypse happening in the background. My friend just sitting, enjoying the view. With a KFC bucket and a few beers on the side. That showcased the potential of graphic design. And I decided to follow this scene.</p>

Let down by the complete lack of instructure improvements, not taking place for, so far, years; After having learned of incredible projects that were supposed to take place nearby, I sketched my own visions. And then used Galaxy Note 3 to refine, Google Map Saver to get the satellite images from and Photoshop to put the puzzles together. After having iterated multiplicitous times and finding the best solutions, while providing alternatives, I have managed to redesign almost all of the most heavily congested areas near the town I used to live and commute to for around 3 years. I don't know if it managed to influence anyone. But things eventually started to happen, just right after my departure to Australia. (2013-2014)</p>

        <h2>Certificate in Advanced English</h2>
        <p>I gotta be frank, I did actually attend an English course at British Council. I considered it a significant waste of money, as I did not get much out of it compared to me just staying in the English-speaking culture, although I did enjoy the learning structure. Especially the combination of tests, it totalled me, a day of drilling through a brains already melted. Just merely after 2 weeks after my High School finals. I was fed up with my mom actually putting me to this, without the provision of any former heads up whatsoever. I was certain, that I would not get as far, as the exam was by far quite harder than what I experienced in my actual finals. Yet, I passed it in seldom flying colors: an average of 72/100? Take a look at the document. In fact, if I didn't get this certificate, nothing that happened afterwards would have taken place, at least so soon. If I received a grade higher by 8 points, I would be considered for a different university. Yet, if I performed worse by a few points, I would not get considered for the course I am in now. Just think of the possibilities?</p>

I discovered my course by an accident. In fact, I did not want to attend this university, for some reasons. Probably because all the other universities seemed like getting a much more significant cashflow, with new buildings actually being built, campuses in their entireties redesigned, while University of Sydney... Orientation was difficult at first and it took me a few approaches until I actually spoke to the right person who pointed out, that well, there is this course which has this really cool website and it's part of the faculty of architecture, design & planning, which obviously I had overlooked... And it indeed had a cool website. And an even better curriculum. And I could potentially get in. I even made a portfolio of what I had left and printed out in A3, which had a real poor presentation, but could potentially have got me an extra up to 5 points. I probably didn't even need any, I got in. And the course that I am attending? I couldn't have chosen any better.</p>

Out of which one seems missing on my end (maybe I'll find it one day, I better hope so!). The final assignment? Create an application in which you may create your own design of some sorts.

I talked about TV Shows. His prescended mine, as far as I recall, on Thursdays at 7. Do you know, how much of an effort it is to make an, at times, 2 hour long radio show, for an actual non-native speaker, without a proper script at times? Especially for myself, who just started to set a life in Sydney and was forced to make choices which ended up in me becoming a solid mess. Nevertheless, I produced around 10 episodes. The first I could not retrieve. 1 other actually got affected by technical difficulties. 2 I shared and the rest? They're back in Sydney for some reason... I plan on doing at least one more show.</p>

        <p>To be honest I did not know what it actually was. I did it 'cause I found it interesting and considering I could write about stuff I actually enjoyed writing just fit well with what I was after. I still actually wrote whatever the hell I wanted, although I did make a small effort to fit in to the requirements. That said, I was still graded more than fairly. And complemented my knowledge with a good set of terminology and literature. I did have a problem, though. I rewrote my essay absatively 3 times and in each case I went beyond my word limit. Eventually, I entwined some politics even. But the problem laid elsewhere. I just actually wrote whatever the hell I wanted. And that was not what was asked of us.

        <h2>Sound Design & Physical Computing</h2>
        <p>How about some sound manipulation? Gotta disclose, I tried learning guitar since... secondary school? Still thinking about it, yet then I had the opporunity to do some other magic in relation to video excerpt. But, I didn't know we were allowed to use sounds that were produced privately by us. It limited me significantly and... well, the result might seem uncompelling. Then, in teams we created a conceptual medical device, which would beep if you walked in an unhealthy fashion. Equipped with an arduino, yet we could have relied on little bits kit.</p>

        <h2>3D Modelling and Fabrication</h2>
        <p>They said: Make a toy! But before, make a concept! For which I ran late. And then, make a toy! In Rhinoceros, like an actual 3D thing. Then reiterate and make a packaging. But before that, we'll print your toy! And I was ambitious! And made myself... a box of chess. That you could disassemble and play. And then assemble, as if it was a rubic cube or something. Well, I did well. And the pleasure of experiencing the toy you just designed first hand? What you see is what you get just became what you make is what you get. And I liked what I made.</p>

        <h2>Web Design & Technologies</h2>
        <p>That course made me dislike a notch Web Development as a whole. First, wireframes. Then, producing a mid-fidelity prototype. And obviously an actual website, which in our case, was to recreate a Velocity Frequent Flyer join page. I was pumped to do the latter part. And neglected the aforementioned. Heavily. 'Cause I simple never have had done it, while today I understand the concept behind the provided structure, I nearly failed the units because of the first two assignments. The final mark does not reflect my knowledge in terms of Web Design. Or maybe it does? Depends on how you enjoy this page alone. I did integrate facebook and google maps apis, though. Got marked relatively highly for my last project, for which I worked tirelessly for 2 straight weeks.</p>

        <p>A speedrun that I undertook, which was around 2 months, having taken an extracurricular course at University of Sydney and smashing all what's included in duolingo somehow lead me towards a half of a certificate. I passed reading by 80/100 and writing by 76/100. I failed speaking ~53;57/60 and listening ~40/100. Yet, that was enough for University of Munich. Furthermore, I kind of had half a certificate of a german language now, how cool is that?!</p>

        <p>I wanted to do this unit from the very beginning. Despite, that it did not include any actual, that is practical game construction. We created a concept as a team. And I provided an actual concept built in an actual Video Game (Crysis Editor), which as I recall, blew the minds of the audiences' and tutor's away. I also recorder a video essay, which was optional, yet, I may have been in the very minority of people actually doing it. And... around a 15 minutes long presentation. In my case about Narrative Architecture in conjunction with game time. Is there anything better than actually doing something that you enjoy doing?</p>

User Experience Design provided us with the right toolsets and knowledge to employ and I just did as much. Research, Concept Development etc. However... I overproduced, to such a degree that I provided a nearly 10000 words (43 pages long!) final document. I literally tried matching all of the expectations and followed every one and each step as close to being right as possible. And with my due dilligence, I tried working even harder to make sure that I did my part right (and that I could go on exchange, duh!). I gotta say, I was pretty burnt out afterwards. But? It was worth it.</p>

Oh man, oh woman, oh the celestial species. Yet, I put a lot of effort and so did my team members. Eventually I actually got an 80, out of which the exam itself 75. What did we have to do? An ER Diagram, something with a working database code and then an actual implementation so that it worked on a website with an actual database, in conjunction with python. We did our projects quite well. Oh and there was a quiz as well. Anyway, I'm still trying to figure out how to feature the works that I was involved with during this course as it will not work without a python run script, that I cannot recall at the moment. But... It will get included.</p>

As a Bachelor, having completed master courses? I don't know in the third place. How did I get so lucky to get myself placed in one of the possibly best student housing complexes, which is the Olympic Village? I don't know in the fourth place. And there is some truth that even follows the magic that I disclosed, which makes my stay here even sweeter than it actually is and definitely more than what I have described. The lectures, the possibility to do my core units on exchange (which I have almost done), the olympic park. Europe itself and that Munich is in the very middle. Cheap flights and high quality of teaching. Close to Warsaw, where most of my friends are located. Seems like paradise, doesn't it? Well, everything comes with a price and the tag I was issued with, contained the requirement of a B1 German Knowledge, for which I had to sprint throughout mere 2 months before submitting all my documents. Making sure that I pass the 3rd semester well was on top of my priorities as well. Yet, once I arrived here, despite all that was handed over to me and how well I was, to sum up, treated. At times I just believe that pearls were casted before the swine. Did I try to match it? Obviously I did. Am I being too hard on myself? Believe me, it's justified. The fact that I was placed here is well beyond even my own comprehension, having done all the other leaps and so on. Still, I believe I have failed, not having done enough as I felt was right.</p>
