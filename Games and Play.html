    That project seemed as if it was going to be yet another essay being written by me. I mean, the thing is about what I usually do. And I do enjoy writing by some mere sequence of consequence. But truly, my experience from Digital Arts? I wrote the essay threefold and it still didn't get as good as I wanted it to be. Yet, now it was a different pair of shoes.<br><br>

    I already mentioned that I enjoy taking the ambitious approach, right? Well, I took it once again. Our tutor introduced the idea of us actually doing a video essay and it was not necessarily what was required of us, a regular essay would perfectly suit, though. As with the video essay there was presumably a fair extra workload required from the students. I decided that it could be a fairly great idea. And after having brainstormed for a little bit, out of all the games I have chosen Life is Strange.<br><br>

    Unfortunately I do have a fair bit against, though I was burnt out, but then I could have made the extra effort of making the video essay as clear as possible. What actually took place was: I have written the essay and read it out, as requested by the tutor. What I read, was meant to correspond with what happend in the video. It did in some lengths and was relatively spoiler-free. That said, despite my reservations, the video essay was well perceived and reviewed by the tutor. Nevertheless, you're the expert, right? So, take a look!<br><br>
