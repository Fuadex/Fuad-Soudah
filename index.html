    Fuad Soudah is my name. 21 years and an aspiring designer, currently on exchange at University of Munich, studying at University of Sydney.<br><br>

    My areas of expertise encompass: Graphic Design, Video Montage and Web Development. Of late, I synergically apply knowledges, to name a few: Human-Computer Interaction, User Experience and Information Visualization in order to deliver the most accommodating solutions. Furthermore, I have a fair knowledge of Database Systems, Programming, Physical Computing and Environmental Development. One hobby is persistently pursued throughout the years was running a detailed, extensive blog, recently enriched by compelling photography that I post-process and capture on my own.<br><br>

  <center><h4>Recap</h4></center><br>
    I was born in St. Leonards, Sydney in the land Down Under. I attended preschool and then the first year of my primary school. After which, my parents somewhat decided, to leave for Poland. These were 6 years of my life, the very start of a journey. There, the school's officers figured I'd be of more use if I went a year back, intead of skipping one ahead. For some reason, I did the entire 6 years in primary school. And then carried on with another 3 years in the very same building, yet under an equivalent system - secondary school. Thereof, I kind of bolted off to a high school that I were not necessarily after. Figuring that I would have no future nor perspectives in the country I just spent 12 years of my life, I used my joker that I got myself reissued a mere 2 years back, for which, surprisingly, I did and did not have to struggle for. The great endeavors of setting up an entirely new life and continuing my old yet came afloat, despite my best and at times lack of efforts. In the end, it didn't really seem that I was in charge of my own life after all. Bouncing off from the better to the unexpected best of the available to the then unforeseen choices that neither were of any significance nor could have been perceived as the adequate way forward. Yet I rolled in a certain direction. Successful in the unsuccess. As if I could conjure up the very real out of the very best from the ultimate mediocre of what was and is trivially called life.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Overview</h4></center><br>

        2 years in Sydney. Filled with joy and struggle. Inertness with breaks for the pursuit of the impossible. I reached yet another destination that I was not exactly after. And yet it became the very best a person in my age could have ever received. I was placed in yet another limbo, to leave which all I had to do was take one step forward. Then I've taken two. And five. Even more, as I was required and then I kept on pushing, gently. To the point that I managed to build something stable with pure perspectives from here on out. Yet, I burried myself under an avalanche, tried to glide instead of taking steps. Once I succeeded, I had no clue what to do next. So I delivered a final push, precariously which this time left a gigantic toll. After recovering from which I then yet realised, then I realised despite my success, I have failed. And that was it. Two months before my exchange ends, I have massive obligations that I am bound to not meet. Once yet again, standing before a decision to find a way and try carrying out, carrying out one last push, raising a deliberate fantasy which would overlook the existing boundaries. At this point it seems possible. A feeling I might have experienced for the very first time not that long ago. Yet, there is no destination in mind. And that, y'all who've been reading this, is the reason for which I have created this website. Lick my wounds. Put everything into and in place. See perhaps if I could finally break free.<br><br>

    I eventually managed to scrape off most of the materials that I have ever built, raised, created and cultivated. In the process, I recalled, finally, ablebodied to put together the crucial parts and a compelling, close to its true nature - a backstory. Every one and each, I believe has, or at the very least deserves a matching story. A little makeup. The tasty details. Sprinkled with insights. Embraced by myself and the magic that comes with.<br><br>

    <center><h4>Webiste</h4></center><br>

    My father is an overqualified Engineer. My mother is greatly skilled in Fine Arts.<br>
    I assume that I established myself a middle ground by binding technical and creative, ultimately becoming a designer.<br>
    And so I managed to acquire a broad selection of knowledges which on top was complemented with writing skills and a digital touch left upon.<br><br>

    The quality of works is of utmost importance and while the process follows or even matches, it is the circumstances in which the projects were raised that breathes and showcases its life. The inspirations, longings, design choices, thinking methods, all the processes, motivations. I did my best to foreclose all of the aforementioned and even more at the utmost of all the angles.<br><br>

    First of all, a common style was introduced on each subpage. My suggestion would be to take a peek at the Education subsection first, which upon investigating (clicking the unit of study), will take you to according subpages with the relevant projects that I have been working on in the past. Most of the materials will be interactive, that is, dependent on external materials such as: youtube and onedrive videos, onedrive presentations, documents and images, flickr images etc. I did my best to reference everyone that was involved in the group projects that I was involved in. If by any chance I happened to miss anyone, please <a href="mailto: fuadex@gmail.com">notify me as soon as possible.</a><br><br>

    Each subpage will contain a backstory, the majority of which will be kept in professional manner. However, extra material will be included, that may shed some light onto the more creative ways that were applied into the creation process of a variety of projects.<br><br>

    Please take a look at my future (including current) projects on the navigation bar included below. A subpage with a list of changes ought to be attached as well. In case if you were trying to reach me, please find the Contact subpage in the top right corner. The cultural subpage will give you a sneakpeak into the cultural background that I was raised in.<br><br>

    I do hope that your stay on my website will be a pleasant one.<br><br>
