    After my exchange period has started, having taken care (as I thought at the time) of most my pre-mobility duties one thing that I actually have had concluded of last minute was taking part in a german intensive language course.<br><br>

    To be frank, I did learn German in my High School. Even in my Secondary School and in fact that was more or less B1 level, which especially in the latter semesters of my High School ascended into the B2 level. Nevertheless, I was fairly (even more) bad and so I had to do a speedrun, which took around 2 months of intensive studying back in Australia on my own and in a class, in which I was politely suggested to step down to a lower level.<br><br>

    Well, after all it all turned out that I didn't really need an actual B1 certificate to be further considered for the possibility of an exchange in Munich, the fact of which I learned thereafter I got to know a few alike exchange folks. But then, I did a gigantic part on my end, which involved taking significant extra load on my pre-exchange semester, which... well, I still believed that taking an extra class could be worth-a-while.<br><br>

    The best part about taking the class was the fact that it was intensive, it took place everyday and I was able to meet a lot of people, even make some friends, one of whom actually came from the very same town area I lived in Poland as well! (Small world, right?) Then, the worst part was that it took place every day and it cost an unpropotional amount of money to what was actually delivered, the experience of which I have known for quite some time now, having taken a variety of english courses and whatnot.<br><br>

    Nevertheless, one of the projects involved the creation of a poster on a specific topic, which at the time, as I believe, it encompassed cultural features of a variety of cultures. Our team decided to take St. Martin's Day, which in fact takes places in a number of countries but just might be most popular in Germany. Each section was written and presented by a different person. Nevertheless, I took care of the visual part in InDesign.<br><br>

    The only part that I regret that could've been better was if I made the poster an A1 version, in A2 it did not seem as compelling as it was supposed to. The background showcases a traditional Martin's Day fire and the variety of sections disclose the cultural features of this day.<br><br>

    The creation of the poster took around a laidback duration of around a week.<br><br>
