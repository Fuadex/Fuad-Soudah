Sehnsucht - ex. Paris (Eng) 
...Femme not that Fatale


Bienvenue.

How much can you see in three days? There are cities, which I consider, straight off the bat, as overhyped, period! And these, that may be worth taking a peek at, but everyone rushes towards in numbers! Could it be, a quality measure? Somehow, I always tried seeking out the gems.. wait, were I about to say, the less known? Although... I've gotta say, that I do have some areas really in need of catching up on, so! I've gotta make the best out of my time around here, while it lasts! Finally and at last, I'm living at the other part of this world, again. I have literally no idea when will be the next time that I'll check up on any of these parts and the transport in Europe is ridiculously cheap! So? Use it, travel, explore, as much as the time allows, as most likely during the upcoming semester I'll be in dire need of (all) the aforementioned.

There is this substantial and ground difference between a number of German cities, which I'm checking on, wandering through and, well, Paris. For instance, I were not that long ago in Leipzig, right? I had, literally, 3.5 hours to check this city out. Meanwhile, I was able to traverse in length and breadth the entire center in 45 minutes. For Paris? I would have needed at the very least a couple of hours and I still would've merely just been able to pierce through its inner boundaries established by the city center bypass. In a way, same goes for the Versailles Palace area (gardens). Would you like to see most of it? Get ready for hell breaking loose in your feet, cause in my case, these three days have proven to be quite murderous, literally, my smartphone told me that I made around a 100 km by foot, if I were to believe electronic gadgets. But then? Even if it's overestimating by a whooping, let's say, 20%, I did get to see almost, like, 80% of what I was planning on seeing in Paris. It made quite an impression. With an overwhelming amount of positives. Really, quite the contrary to what I've expected and to what I've heard every now and then from a handful of people.


Augenblick im Louvre

I began wondering, in a way, what if Warsaw was not razed to the ground. Would we have had such rampant in numbers, in my eyes, secessionist architecture, just like in the north-western side of Paris? Would we have had, built with such great momentum Palaces, in which exhibited would be one of the most notable pieces of art? Perhaps inhabitants would have been just as pleasant in everyday life? A high number of minorities, integrated socially and compatible with its nation? Perhaps we would have established our own champions, making a killing on foreign markets?

Well, let's kinda start from the very beginning. As I've already mentioned, I just have had merely 3 days to see as much as possible. I took a flixbus, a night connection, which meant sleeping on this very bus and well, it was not necessarily the best choice, but quite optimal as it turned out and relatively pleasant. Did I already mention that I've decided to see as much as possible? Well, it seems to have forged into some kind of a life motto or something. But, well. I guess I kinda took it too seriously and once I reached Port D'Orleans, I swiftly disembarked and started off my journey, with its arrival postponed by a not-that-necessarily-whooping half an hour. But it was already daylight, which was not the case a mere hour ago. That's right, funny feeling, the bloody day actually started off at... was it actually 9 o'clock? Anyway, I lost track of time, but that's of quite minor importance. Although it did affect my first impressions of the city, which were the following. Heavily industrial in the southern part. Great traffic jams, out of which we somehow made it out. Aaaand... a quite relatively messed up infrastructural area of Port D'Orleans. But then, as far my memory reaches, there was literally nothing. And nothing. And again nothing. Then? A city. A huge city. A really huge city. And once we've hit the jam? I thought we were at destination. Was it though? Nah. We still had a bit! One word that comes to my mind? Metropolis. Authentic and authentically, on its great landscapes there were blocks of flats and highrises outstretched throughout the entire area. And the aforementioned industrial zone, which quite peculiarly complemented the witty welcoming image.



Once I made my step outside? No fireworks, no nothing. People running, a heavily congested crossroads, planned as if someone got mad and figured that any solution might be a great solution. So what? Let's head north! By subway? No way! By foot! Seriously, the idea itself was not that bad, not that bad at all, although my energy levels got wiped out quite, quite soon. But! Every cloud has a silver lining! I got to see a fair bit of the city and the very rest? I made by foot, throughout most of my time spent here. 'now I could go on to describing my entire journey, but who cares?'. I think I might have been reaching it a little back then, but I might have had a fair point, that it's the 'more than meets the eye' details that y'all might be most likely interested in. So... let's see how translating the following goes and if I figure some descriptions might be needed? I'll fill ya all in!

So, the key details. First of all? From district, to district. Paris really differs, quite heavily. Did I just over-exaggerate now? Well, however! All of it. And I mean it, all of it! Compose in some logical (structurally) whole. There is this kind of marvelous breath of natural, buoyant chaos. Take the structure of its streets. Paris seems as if an autistic with Tourette's sketched it. From multiple, key, well maintained and logically structured alleys, manifold backstreets backfire, scattered all around. Some quite just as well maintained, but then, the chaos is clearly perceived, especially at the crossroads. However, there is this, lively harmony, cause even in this chaos, where pedestrians crossing on red light is seen as normal, everything seems to be working... surprisingly well!

This harmonious chaos is tiered. There you go, ethnically. It's quite a fascinating (in my own terms) matter, as multiple voices were raised and reached me beforehand, I have seen it myself how it looks like in Lille, which surfaced quite a bit of negativeness, impression-wise. Chaos alike, although uncontrolled and rotten, as if utilizing the magic of its city, the same direness? I have not experienced in Paris. Of all the people that I've seen and met on my way were French. Natives and that was quite distinctive, as a feeling, as part of what I perceived, as in Berlin for instance, this city seems extremely multi-ethnic, yet, disintegrated and not this city alone! Nevertheless, there is a quite high coefficient of people with dark complexion in Paris, yet, most of these that I've met on my way, were individuals who have seemed near, quite fully integrated with the society, operating French fluently, in fact, Frenchmen, by how they are and get by, how they behave and thrive, style in which they dress up and dine. Although, I did come across some middle-eastern groups, which did actually stand out from this picture, mostly youthful, which does not prognosticate well, unfortunately.



Let's go further. What I found, despite the apparently quite socialist picture of France itself (its government at the very least and the decisions it made), I found Paris quite appealing, even quite heavily, because of its natural chaos. It felt a tiny bit as if the Paris that I've known from reading that one Polish book a while back... Well, a bit less exaggerated in details, tho. On Sundays, shops are not rather really closed shut. They rather remain open until late hours, for instance Carrefour lasts until 11 pm and not that shop alone! Although, it's not necessarily the best example, as it is a chain store, this one exists in a deli-format and in fact, none of these chain stores are really visible in the capital. Would you wish for a large format supermarket? Forget about it, even I got surprised, although there are some bakery chains operating in numbers, it seems that most are operated privately, by its' sole owners, offering a range of products. On top of that, most of the French that I've come across were really quite pleasant! Mere a trifle, but uncoerced, just, plain, natural.

Now, back to our chain stores and the remaining. It is quite a telltale picture, especially when I speak of boutiques. These are in numbers, multiplicitous, especially in some districts! And the design of the clothing, apparel, attire, you name it! In fact, all over the site, each place? I found quite appealing, so much that I really wondered if I should actually get anything. As I usually run into problems in getting, pretty much anything, yet finding anything worth catching my eyes and believe me! I am not one of these people who are really keen on hitting any clothing shops to begin with or getting even a damn pair of shoes, in contrast, in case of these boutiques I always had an item on which I laid my eyes on. And clothing myself up in one of these joints? That would be just pure pleasure. What's even more intriguing, these small businesses are in fact (I hope I'm right) individually lead enterprises. Which leads towards a conclusion, that French are in fact more willing to choose, well, I'm not entirely quite sure if local food (although there are food stalls mounted in numbers on the weekends, attended by numbers as well), but in case of acquiring attire at local tailors? If they didn't, most likely most of these venues would have closed down, meanwhile... the quality! French people dress quite well, by the way.



Now. Perhaps a few words about museums? Lately I've realized, that if I'm going to travel a bit, then perhaps I ought to taste a bit of the 'high culture', for instance museums. It is kinda the case that I've been raised on this, so perhaps I ought to go a bit further, bite the bullet, take the bull by its horns, see how far I may reach and perhaps beef my brain up with a notch more of alike, see more than meets the eye material to compare against the real world. Cause, why not? It's kinda expected, from people altogether. To be cultural, n' all. Know some history. A bit of this, bit of that. Some education, ya know. To begin with or to end it with? If there was any city on this world.. well, my mother mentioned New York as some sort of a major hub, notwithstanding! Apparently in the states they've got good museums altogether (although it is a different world, hush!), notwithstanding! Hold on and up, I gotta make my words flow as the waves on the dead sea (heh).

Well, in general, I went the Palace of Versailles, right? Prepared for some hefty fine to lodge in, get raped by the insane prices for so-called adults, whilst being a mere student. Buuut, let's fast-forward 'till a bit. Or ya know what? Better yet, let's focus on that building, I'll go off the script for that one. Well, imagine a... palace. And make it, better yet, a fuckton of a Palace. A gigantic Palace, with, let's figure, 300 small-medium, rather medium sized rooms, located all around it, spread across it's two, kickass huge wings. That not enough? Well, make it wider! Aaand, a bit even wider. How about making it a two-story building? With a probably, extra rooftop space and a room height equal to around 1.5-2 times of a normal building's height? Then throw in a bit of a SHITLOAD of abundance in and there ya go. A pack full of tons of gold, bit of paintings, extravagant styling, a gigantic amount of chairs dating probably hundreds of years back... Some sculptures and... engraved patterns in various items and... painted ceilings, usually alone, not accompanied by painted walls. A room with a fuckload of chandeliers... I think I'm going a notch too far off script now. But, let's wander off bit further. Actually, really further. 'Cause you know how huge the Versailles gardens are? That's right! Gigantic. How gigantic? Probably takes-around-more-than-30-minutes-to-get-from-point-A-to-B type of garden. And at the very least a double, if you'd like to quickly see the most notable attractions and quadruple, if you'd like to enjoy it a bit more and perhaps even more, if you'd like to keep your feet all good and healthy and ready to see the rest of Paris.



To sum up, though. Pageantry, sumptuousness. Gigantic amounts of gold. Quite Baroque-like style. A lot of everything. A few more eye catching rooms, for instance the one with a not-that-fair amount of chandeliers. The other one with giant paintings and engraved, golden ceiling. Beyond the palace? Tremendous amount of terrain. Gigantic squares on each side. A few smaller structures, such as a farm. Even more rooms to be seen, how the monarchs used to live in the past. And this palace was supposed to be used primarily for hunting. The pomp was exorbitant. But well, perhaps in the past, they used to follow different standards. Perhaps if I had used to know how they used to live, back then, in the past, I would protest and raise revolutions myself. A Red Fuad? That would've been a golden phenomenon, at the very least.

Now, the thing is. Yes, if you're in Paris, you should probably see the Versailles, just because you... can. It's not necessarily something terrific, a super must see building, although I gotta say, the gardens are somewhat refreshing and you may calm yourself down properly in the area. Although, it is a gigantic complex and... well, if you're above 26 years old and most specifically from outside EU, then yeah, you'll have to pay quite a bit, 18 Euros for the pleasure of experiencing this entire complex, however..! If you're under 26 years and a EU citizen... well... all you need is your ID and... you're free to experience pretty much anything culturally related in Paris! Oh la la! WUTWUTWUT. Yep. Free Free Free. Everything free of charge. Go get culturally raped, your minds blown with art and culture. Stuff even more and even more, even when you can't handle more, just consume as if you were a stereotypical true 'murican at burger king, whoopin' on a triple whooper and a gallon of coke. Use Leonardo da Vincis magical swifts at the Louvre. Get mesmerized at Orangerie by the 360 painting of Monet. How about some transversal journey through contemporary art at Center Pompidou? And some of the best impressionistic journey you'll ever experience in your life at D'Orsay! Everything for free. Just stuff it, stuff it in your head. Enjoy and ride through the schasms of art and culture!



Yeaaaah. Now back to script! Let's start of with fast-forwarding now to the Louvre, cause except for the gardens and the palace at Versailles, only a few smaller buildings with some art and a kinda hobbit-land with a farm was left untouched (and one area that I didn't dear to reach). So? The Louvre. What's there to be said? How about you take this shitload of space that you've just imagined what was the Palace of Versailles and now... just make it narrower. Squeeze it as much as you can, add perhaps a few more stories to this building, locate a part of it under the surface and make it squarified in the back, still preserving it's pointy two cannons on each side. And... I'd say, double the space, but that's kinda a far-fetched idea. Give it, in between 1.5-2 times the size of Versailles. Remember, The Louvre used to be a palace as well! Now it's a great, übermuseum, in which you may find... well. Ladies and Gentlemen. In order, to see what's in store at this museum, you'd need to spend... well, if you're after thoroughly checking every and each corner, let's say that at the very least, that would make it around 10 hours. Yeah, 7-14 hours seems about right. Still, you may even in such case miss out on a bit. Once you roll in through the security checks, you get an option to start exhibiting three different wings.

What does it have in store? Well, entire sets of antiques encompassing lengthy time-spans. You may find ancient Egypt, Roman times, Greek and Middle-Eastern, a bit of Oriental and... all antiques, an abundance and in numbers. A great deal of French exhibits from pretty much all of the times, with a great focus on decorative art... even entire rooms renovated to match how it used to be during the Napoleon times, which, trust me fellas, blew my brains out in terms of how great of a presentation it struck upon me. The design! I mean it! Napoleon Quarters. But, then, ya know. I just merely touched 2-3 stories. Also, some temporary exhibitions are held in some of the rooms. A few were closed off, unfortunately. One element that I do remember quite vividly and which I find particularly ravishing is that the living artists are actually allowed to bring their stuff in, well, at the very least sketchists are allowed to do their work to draw other works inside the museum. I came across at least a few fellas doing it and nobody having anything against it. They had sculptures from the French times, Islamic Art, sculptures from Europe. Italian and Etruscan antiques! Arts from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas! I guess, that's about it, in case of sculptures, decorative art and antiques anyway.



Are you looking for some paintings? Welcome to the club. Well, but don't worry, the Louvre without paintings would be as if Napoleon lost his army (oh, well, he eventually did, heh). Anyway, around a total of 1.5 stories. Despite the museum rather concentrating on antiques (and sculptures and decorative arts), it's got in store a great deal of paintings, especially the ones that take monstrous amounts of space. A considerable amount of Italian paintings (especially the religious ones). A total of 6 Leonardo da Vinci paintings, with Mona Lisa being the most notable, presented gloriously in one of the palace's rooms. a bit of Spanish art... A whoopin' amount of French, with Eugène Delacroix as its most notable headliner. Although it seems that there were more that I actually do have a recollection of: Théodore Chassériau, Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Eustache Le Sueur, Peter Paul Rubens, and Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes with over 50 works being exhibited there! Have you seen (to my polish mates here) Matejko's Battle of Grunwald painting? To all the mates that do not know it, it's a painting the size of a, let's assume, the largest existing cinema screen. Well, imagine even larger paintings! They do have such in The Louvre. At least they seemed as such.

Ain't ya done with museums? Turns out, me neither. And there is a great competitor, which actually has guns ever larger than The Louvre. The museum's name is... D'Orsay. Let's say, they've got Picasso. How superficial! But they've got tons beyond Picasso! Monet, Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh... Pissaro, Boudin, Moreau, Corot, Courbet, Morisot, Sisley, Bazille, Renoir, Vuillard, Bonnard... Hey, I'm not finished, they've got even more + temporary exhibitions! In fact, D'Orsay is a museum, most likely smaller by 2/3 compared to the Louvre. The only substantial difference, though, is that it's filled primarily with paintings. With such a collection, that you could've built perhaps 4 or even 10 other museums and stuff them up with the collection from D'Orsay, being the headliner compared to all the other stuff that could be presented (isn't it sad, pretentious, conceited, ridiculous and quite a paradox, me sprouting the aforementioned words?). In fact, my brain was already overloaded with art, it begged me for some kind of cloud to which it could dump all the education that I was somehow able to stuff it in. My feet were already close to feeling as if amputation was the ultimate way out for them. And I, somehow, against my brains and body, decided to march on and see the rest of what was in store at D'Orsay. I was truly glad to and eventually my body parts have forgiven me altogether. How could they not? It was just too good to be true. I wish I had more time just to appreciate the painting, though.



Oh, you haven't had enough yet? Well, Orangerie is not that far away. Would you like a bit more of Monet? Well, how about two oval rooms in which you may experience his paintings curved in such a way as if you were experiencing an actual, 360 (!) painting? There are more paintings crafted that went straight out off his hands. But, well, you may find even more of Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, Rousseau, Sisley... Soutine. Relatively close quarters, really cozy museum. However, it turned out that these were not this day's highlight. No no no. Actually, there was a temporary exhibition of American artists. The leading theme? I believe it was... America during the industrial (?) times (1920-1950 etc; probably I'm mistakin'). As funny as it seems, I haven't seemed to have known any of the authors. Not even one. Null. There was a great interest in this exhibition (it was merely between 9-10 o'clock!), photographing was forbidden. It kinda depicts a... well, that I merely concentrate on the European art, meanwhile... somewhere out there... a complete, different.. outer world exists. Beyond the ocean. And deserts. In South America. In Small Asia and its bigger brother. In America. They don't know our countries, we don't know their states. Meanwhile, here and there, either, exists a culture. And Parisians actually elicit their interest in culture. Their own and beyond.

Alrighty, look, the last building: Center Pompidou. The thing is, center for contemporary art, although, this kinda quasi-industrial thing encompasses on quite a fair bit of hectares and raises upon such a height, that you may even enjoy the cityspace of Paris (!!). I was able to see just one story of the permanent exhibition. And you know what? It was worth it. This story alone depicted the entire evolution of epochs, in general styles, which shifted from room to room with styles and different artists being presented in each. Its' evolution... I even got to know a new style there. And man, they had Dali, Pollock, Warhol, Ernst, Picasso, Beckmann, Dubuffet, Dali, Rothko... Well, whatever floats your boat, all was there to be enjoyed and as it turned out, that was just one story that I had the opportunity to(of?) enjoy(ing?). And yeah. Again. Your EU ID being under 26 serves as your private bloody passport around all the museums in the area. Once again, you're the young VIP. Borders free for knowledge and education. It's bloody poetic!



Anyway. You know what? Take Versailles for example. It's as if Paris is a reflection of itself, of how humongous it is. Everything's being raised with such a momentum, that it's close to ridiculous. Palaces? Oh, there's a handful out there. Each, looks like a palace and is just as big or even bigger as a few of the (sub?)standard palaces. But then? I figured, hell yeah, I'll take a peek at the Elysian Palace. Guess what? Upon my eyes, exception to the norm, apparently it's the presidential palace, but it seemed more like a prison. There was nothing really within reach for the eyes to perceive, except for the walls, metal barriers set up everywhere, plentiful of police cars and officers themselves patrolling with a visible hint of French soldiers overseeing the area. In fact, I need to state at that point that I knew of the emergency of state still being upheld by the government. Although, I figured that it'd look a tiny bit worse than just as expected. A few squads of soldiers that I've seen were located around the Eiffel Tower, Sacre-Coeur (picturesque view from north of Paris down south..) and... the Elysian Palace. What bothers a bit more are the security checks, though. They check everybody, they even introduced a different line for people who have already bought the tickets! They are quite scrupulous while checking the luggage (and clothing), paradoxically they're more chilled out in the larger venues such as The Louvre compared to smaller ones such as Orangerie! Even shopping centers check its visiting customers, same goes for cathedrals. My mom's comment: 'Do they care more about art pieces or people?'. In pure theory, gigantic queues may prove as perfect terrorist targets... Just sayin'.

The city differs vertically as well. In the southern part I received an impression of, as if, the city was way more lively, people bustling from one point to another, cafes, bakeries, major traffic heading sideways all over. Such a beautiful, sublime chaos, that I ran out of words of how to express what I had felt back then. Astonishing wonder, raspberries and honey, beauty in its true, harmonious nature, although... that was just the southern part. Surprisingly, or perhaps it was just that I arrived on Friday, rather than the weekend, on which supposedly everything is open as well anyway? The mid-cityspace viewed from the balcony, located a little further north up the south-eastern railway station gives a glimpse of how Paris works, with all its cogs, all over the place, set in motion, hardly getting stuck, but the machine keeps on rolling.



Little further up north, around la Sen, you may experience a typical, imperial architecture. Golden griffins (?) mounted around a bridge. Palaces... Oh, I've already mentioned them? What I kept out were a few other items and locations, cause when I say that they build with an impetus, such a momentum that it makes you feel really small in this universe, I mean it. I mean, the triumphal arch? It's so big that you'd imagine you're a lego-block compared to this guy. And there's enough space in the neighboring roundabout for more than 6 cars stuck right next to each other. That's not the end, though. Up to 12 different connecting alleys go off from this roundabout. Including the Elysian Fields, which are just damn mesmerizing, that's what they are. Straight and wide, connecting the triumphal arch with another main square in Paris. Oh, did I already mention how huge this place is? I guess back in the days it was perfect for demonstrating, 'oh, how great my army is.'. Also, the Handicapped Square next to which I've been living was quite massive as well. I think at the palace down south might have had a solid museum of arms and whatever wars consist of (or does actually not?). Also, the northern part seems... quiet. Monumental. Secessionist architecture? Here and there and everywhere, although, no cafes to be seen all over! No nothing (anything?). Raw buildings, a hint of plants... a lot of parked cars along the street. And that was the case until I've had reached the hill.

You know what I find amusing? As though chaos. As if order. Presumably no contrast, though they exist, subtle. Meanwhile, I've heard of a lot bad stuff that's been happening around here and the country itself, yet, I have not experienced anything out of the ordinary. To the contrary, quite pleasant experience, even while looking at it in multiple vectors. Even while experiencing the Parisian metro, despite the quite archaic structure of public transport and despite the bakeries being expensive, in spite of that... I tried so hard to come up with something, which would have been an authentic drawback, potentially keeping you away from Paris, I was not really successful in finding any (good ones). Although, at a few locations, I did sense that something felt off, such as in the area of Gare du Nord station. But then, I gotta mention, that I failed to track down the real French cuisine in Paris. In bakeries, in fact, a tiny bit different assortment, Galette was quite a fancy pastry, of which larger pieces were being sold for over 30 euros (!) a piece. Crepes were all over the place, but then, my grandma makes identical back home, even better ones! So, is it the cuisine that you're after in Paris? Well, you gotta make some heavy research on this, cause I'm sure that there is something, but nothing that I've come across made the right impression of something truly French.



Paris, in fact, presented itself as Paris, what surprised me quite positively. I was expecting more of a.. well, a city in shambles, to say it lightly and politely. The city center is massive and I've trodden plenty of kilometers to feel the city, how it looks like, how the people behave in everyday life. To capture how this city just is, as itself, a standalone and with all its details, blissful or not. In three days, I've managed to see quite a fair bit. In my honest opinion, enough, perhaps around 80% of what was on my agenda. I intercepted the atmosphere, but missed out on the eastern and south-eastern parts. With great pleasure I would visit once again all of these museum and checked out on all the others. I'd try to visit Sacre Coeur at the very morning, perhaps some other to experience the magnificent colors of the sun descending. In such a city you may keep on treading throughout for like an entire week. It's worth to keep in mind that Paris is a really humongous city, so perhaps, what they say about really quite dangerous districts, has its reflection in real life.

Despite that! It's a city, from my personal perspective: cultural, multi-tiered, universal. It will probably speak to every each one of you, regardless of the attitude you arrive with. I guess, it's just a city that you ought to see and most likely should see. Especially if you're under 26. And that's just about it folks!


I agree.
